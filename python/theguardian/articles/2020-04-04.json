A total of 4,853 new test results came in. That was higher than the average the state was registering earlier in the week, but exactly how many of those were older results wasn\u2019t clear.</p> <p>The number of new deaths reported Saturday was lower than on Friday \u2013 39 as opposed to 60 \u2013 but higher than Thursday\u2019s toll of 37.</p> <p>On the contrary, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and on life-saving ventilator machines was higher than Friday: 1,726 and 571, respectively. Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile.</p> <p>Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in.</p> <p>The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager.</p> <p>Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:44:27.018Z\">at 11.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e8905828f08c35a1d11a1cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T22:09:16.021Z\">11.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States.</p> <p>\u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers.

Let me put this in a proper, yet very sobering context. We have now lost nearly 100 more of our fellow New Jerseyans to Covid-19 that we did on the September 11th attacks. Please let that sink in for a moment. This pandemic is writing one of the greatest tragedies in our state\u2019s history and just as we have committed to never forget the lives lost on 9/11, we must commit to never forgetting those we are losing to this pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cLet\u2019s just all remember again: this is war. We are in a war. How do you win wars? You don\u2019t panic and you don\u2019t go business-as-usual. You win it by being smart, aggressive, proactive, shooting straight with each other, being honest about the toll that is both before us and will continue to grow. Let\u2019s not kid each other. You win wars by not turning on each other, but to the contrary, coming together. This extraordinary diverse state coming together as one family. </p> <p>\u201cYou win a war because your work harder than the next folks. You win it because you show courage as we\u2019re seeing every single day up and down this state, from our frontline healthcare workers, to every single one of the nine million of us, including folks right now at home by themselves doing exactly what we need. Every single one of us is a hero right now. Every single one of us must do our part if we are to flatten the curve of this virus, allow our healthcare system to be able to deal with it properly and then emerge on the other side. And unequivocally may I say, if we all do our part, there is no question in my mind we will win this war and we will emerge from it stronger as one New Jersey family, more together than ever before.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T19:31:46.611Z\">at 8.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e88bfdd8f08c35a1d11a0c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T17:12:30.958Z\">6.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/donald-trump-decapitating-intelligence-leadership-coronavirus-crisis-senior-democrat\">said</a> Donald Trump is \u201cdecapitating the leadership of the intelligence community in the middle of a national crisis\u201d and \u201csettling scores\u201d after the president fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community, late on Friday night.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on MSNBC on Saturday. \u201cAnd of course it sends a message throughout the federal government and in particular to other inspectors general that if they do their job as this professional did and Michael Atkinson was a complete professional, they too may be fired by a vindictive president.\u201d</p> <p>House speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff\u2019s alarm, calling the firing of the Trump appointee \u201ca brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty\u201d.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/donald-trump-decapitating-intelligence-leadership-coronavirus-crisis-senior-democrat\">Trump is 'decapitating' intelligence leadership amid crisis, senior Democrat says</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e88bb888f080bdb9f53441b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jessica-glenza\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-04T16:56:21.998Z\">5.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a bit more on New York\u2019s ventilator hunt from our health reporter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Chinese billionaires and the state of Oregon facilitated ventilator donations to New York to treat patients with Covid-19, as the pandemic accelerates toward a peak.</p> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, while President Trump again promoted an unproven malaria drug as treatment for Covid-19 on Twitter.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described that crescendo of cases as, \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy.\u201d In addition to the 1,000 ventilators obtained from China, Cuomo said Oregon loaned New York 140 ventilators.</p> <p>Current projections put the peak of the pandemic anywhere between four and 14 days away.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Trump touts hydroxychloroquine as a cure for Covid-19 during his daily briefing. The anti-malaria drug could be \u2018one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u2019, Trump claimed, but there is no magic cure. The president accuses states of asking for unneeded supplies and media of spreading fake news. Trump used his briefing to further his assertions that media outlets were spreading false information about shortages of ventilators and protective equipment. Cruise ship docks in Florida with two dead and 12 testing positive for coronavirus. The Coral Princess pulls into Miami with 1,000 passengers and 878 crew, after being refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale. Adam Schiff said Trump was \u2018decapitating\u2019 intelligence leadership amid coronavirus crisis. The chair of the House intelligence committee made the comments to MSNBC after the president fired the inspector general of the US intelligence community late on Friday night. Andrew Cuomo thanks China for ventilators as New York prepares for coronavirus peak. The New York governor announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. He also said Oregon would be lending 140 more. US has 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. President Trump has approved Arizona governor Doug Ducey\u2019s request for a major disaster declaration. \u201cThis continued collaboration will be crucial as we utilize all tools to combat this virus,\u201d Ducey said. A release from Ducey\u2019s office said the declaration will ensure federal resources will be supplied to Arizona to help provide access to mental health care, unemployment assistance, legal services, hazard mitigation, nutritional aid and crisis counseling. As of Saturday morning, Arizona had reported 2,019 coronavirus cases and 52 deaths. Here\u2019s our colleague Oliver Milman\u2019s story on Trump\u2019s bold hydroxychloroquine claim during today\u2019s briefing: Faced with a global coronavirus pandemic that is increasingly centered upon the US, Donald Trump has touted several drugs that he claims can help tackle the outbreak. The US president last week used a press conference to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine, a common anti-malaria drug, to treat Covid-19, saying: \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try.\u201d He followed this with a tweet that claimed the use of the drug in combination with azithromycin, an antibiotic, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. Trump was immediately contradicted by public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, who warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. Confronted with this disparity Trump, who has repeatedly made false and misleading assertions throughout the coronavirus crisis and indeed his entire presidency, responded by telling reporters that \u201cI\u2019m a smart guy\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve been right a lot.\u201d The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity seem to be satisfied by this assurance and have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows. But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and potentially deadly, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic. With New Orleans having emerged as one of the national hotspots in the coronavirus outbreak, Louisiana state medical officials are preparing for Monday\u2019s re-opening of the Ernest N Morial Convention Center as a makeshift, 1,000-bed medical support facility to ease the strain on local hospitals. Dr Joseph Kanter, the assistant state health officer, said the field hospital could double its capacity to 2,000 beds by the end of the month if necessary, saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t even halfway over \u2013 it is not time to let up. Standing in a convention hall housing a football field\u2019s worth of white tents, nurses\u2019 stations and portable handwashing basins, Kanter cast a quick glance around and said, \u201cHow great would it be if we didn\u2019t need half this?\u201d The number of state residents stricken with Covid-19 jumped Saturday to 12,946, an increase of about 2,200 from the previous day. The New Orleans area continues to be the epicenter of the outbreak in Louisiana, with 3,966 known cases and 154 deaths reported out of Orleans Parish. Neighboring Jefferson Parish has another 3,008 known cases, 95 of them fatal. To what extent Saturday\u2019s hike resulted from an increased testing rate is unclear. A total of 4,853 new test results came in. That was higher than the average the state was registering earlier in the week, but exactly how many of those were older results wasn\u2019t clear. The number of new deaths reported Saturday was lower than on Friday \u2013 39 as opposed to 60 \u2013 but higher than Thursday\u2019s toll of 37. On the contrary, the number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital and on life-saving ventilator machines was higher than Friday: 1,726 and 571, respectively. Those will not alleviate the state\u2019s concerns about a looming shortage in hospital bed space and ventilators, though officials announced Saturday that Louisiana would receive an additional 200 ventilators from the national stockpile. Keeping bed space in New Orleans area hospitals as ample as possible is where the makeshift hospital at the convention center comes in. The pop up facility \u2013 which is costing more than $90 million to build, equip and staff, largely through a contractor \u2013 is meant to treat COVID-19 patients who no longer need acute treatment at a hospital but still require care they can\u2019t get at home, said Dr. Meghan Maslanka, the site\u2019s medical operations manager. Such patients \u2013 who need a hospital referral to be admitted \u2013 will be treated and observed in tent rooms that are about the size of backyard sheds. In concluding the daily briefing, Trump says we are approaching a \u201chorrendous\u201d time in the outbreak across the United States. \u201cWe are getting to that time where the numbers are going to peak and it is not going to be a good-looking situation,\u201d the president says. \u201cI really believe we\u2019ve probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war, a world war one or two or something. But this is a war, all into itself, and it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d Trump continues to lobby for hydroxychloroquine as a preventative for coronavirus. \u201cI just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins, coupled with perhaps the Z-Pak as we call it, depending totally on your doctors and the doctors there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a possibility \u2013 a possibility \u2013 and I say it: what do you have to lose? I\u2019ll say it again: what do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it\u2019s their choice and it\u2019s their doctor\u2019s choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you like.\u201d Birx says the counties in and around New York, Detroit and New Orleans are on the upsides of their curves and will all hit together in the next seven days. \u201cThey\u2019re all on the upside of their curve of mortality, so you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side,\u201d Birx says. \u201cBy the predictions that are in that healthdata.org, they\u2019re predicting those three hotspots all of them hitting together in the next six to seven days.\u201d Trump steps in as Fauci is underscoring the efficacy of social distancing, circling back on his central theme of the day: the need to reopen the country as soon as possible. \u201cMitigation does work but again, we\u2019re not going to destroy our country,\u201d the president says. \u201cAt a certain point you\u2019ll lose more people this way through all of the problems caused. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. OK?\u201d Trump says he considered moving to relax stay-at-home orders nationwide so parishioners could celebrate Easter Sunday next week. \u201cPalm Sunday, tomorrow,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThink of it. We\u2019re not going to churches on Palm Sunday. But think of next Sunday: Easter. And I brought it up before, I said, maybe we could allow a special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s something we should talk about. But somebody did say, \u2018Well, then you\u2019re sort of opening it up to ... do we want to take a chance on doing that when we\u2019ve been doing so well?\u2019 \u201cBut Easter Sunday! Palm Sunday, I\u2019m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California \u2013 great church \u2013 but I\u2019m going to be watching on a computer. On a laptop. I think on Easter maybe I\u2019ll be watching on a laptop. How sad is it that we have Easter, Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It\u2019s sad. But the job that this whole country has done is amazing.\u201d Trump, who says he\u2019s tested negative for Covid-19 on two occasions, says he may start to take hydroxychloroquine, adding that it may be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for treating the virus. \u201cIf it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway,\u201d Trump said about the drug, which has yet to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cI may take it. OK? I may take it. And I\u2019ll have to ask my doctors about that but I may take it.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some very preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent coronavirus from entering cells, but experts have warned of its major potential side effects, especially for the heart. Trump points out yesterday\u2019s news that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s campaign supports the president\u2019s decision to ban foreign nationals who had been in China within the previous 14 days from entering the United States. \u201cBreaking news last night, you know that you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early from coming into our country,\u201d Trump says. Shortly after, a reporter asks the president to comment on Biden\u2019s tweet from roughly an hour ago, where the former vice-president said Trump \u201cis not responsible for the coronavirus, but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it\u201d. Says Trump: \u201cHe didn\u2019t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn\u2019t write. He\u2019s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s watching.\u201d He adds: \u201cThey released [the tweet] at a strange time. Sort of strange time to release something like that, but he admitted I was right.\u201d \u201cI thought he did a terrible job,\u201d Trump says of Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community who was fired on Friday night. He says Atkinson was a \u201ctotal disgrace\u201d and should have looked at the transcript of his \u201cperfect call\u201d with the Ukrainian president before taking any action. Trump says he called the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, today: \u201cI said I\u2019d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug the president believes could be helpful as a therapeutic. Dr Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, follows Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, saying \u201cwe are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials and use if doctors think it\u2019s appropriate\u201d. Trump says his administration is using the Defense Production Act \u201cvery powerfully\u201d, saying Fema and HHS have ordered 180m N95 masks. \u201cWe need the masks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other people getting them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re instuting a lot of Defense Production Act. You could call it retaliations because that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s a retaliation. If people don\u2019t give us what we need for our people, we\u2019re going to be very tough.\u201d The president says 1,000 military personnel will deploy to New York City, which has continued to surge as a \u201chotspot\u201d for Covid-19 cases. Trump adds: \u201cWe will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we\u2019ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure and get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don\u2019t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We have to open our country again. This country wasn\u2019t meant for this. Few were, few were. But we have to open our country again.\u201d Trump then lists the sports commissioners that he spoke with earlier today, adding Nascar president Steve Phelps, who was omitted from the handout provided by a White House spokesperson earlier in the day. \u201cThese are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThe sports weren\u2019t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn\u2019t designed for it.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing, alongside vice president Mike Pence, virus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx and infection disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci, by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d He continues: \u201cThis will be probably the toughest week, between this week and next week, and there will be a lot of death, unfortunately. But a lot less death than if this wasn\u2019t done, but there will be death. We\u2019re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest-hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some are not so obvious. They spring up, they hit you like you got hit by a club. An area that wasn\u2019t at all bothered \u2013 you look at what\u2019s going on in New Jersey, the governor is doing an excellent job by the way \u2013 but how that sprang up. Every decision we\u2019re making is made to save lives. It\u2019s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. The president then immediately pivots toward the media: \u201cIt\u2019s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible. I could name them but it\u2019s the same ones. Always the same ones. I guess they looking for ratings. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for. So bad for our country. The people understand it. Look at the levels and approval ratings, they\u2019re the lowest they\u2019ve ever been for media. So bad for our country, so bad for the world. Put it together for a little while. Get this over with and then go back to your fake news.\u201d Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing by noting his administration\u2019s efforts to work with state governments in New York, Texas and Louisiana to get temporary hospitals built and staffed, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible situation. There\u2019s never been anything like this.\u201d Although President Trump has resisted instituting a national shelter-in-place recommendation to combat coronavirus \u2013 in contrast with top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s advice \u2013 87% of US residents said they\u2019re trying to stay home when possible, according to a new survey. A mere 7% of US residents said they are not making such an effort, while 6% reported being \u201cunsure\u201d. The Huffington Post/YouGov poll also indicated overwhelming support of stay-at-home mandates, with 79% of US residents saying their states were right in issuing such orders. The survey also found that approximately 61% of US residents would keep staying home this month when possible even if their states started lifting restrictions. About 19% said they would return to living \u201cas normally as possible if restrictions were lifted\u201d, per the research. The New York Post appears to have first outlet other than Huffington Post reporting on this study, which was based on 1,000 completed interviews conducted from 27 to 31 March. \u201cThose findings shouldn\u2019t be taken as absolute or immovable. People aren\u2019t necessarily great at predicting their own actions in a future hypothetical situation. That\u2019s especially true now, with the outbreak continuing to rapidly unfold and statements from the White House varying greatly in tone and content,\u201d the study noted. \u201cThe results, however, do suggest the majority of the public is hunkering down not merely out of duress, but also out of their own genuine concerns \u2013 and that they\u2019re prepared to continue doing so for at least some time.\u201d Just about 25% of US residents said they thought things would soon return to normal, as 62% expected \u201clasting effects on the nation\u201d. \u201cThe rest are unsure what will happen.\u201d The survey, released Thursday, comes as several states have remained slow to enact efforts in the fight against Covid-19. Alabama\u2019s stay-at-home order is only just going into effect Saturday at 5pm,. Arkansas has not implemented this kind of mandate. Iowa, Nebraska, as well as North and South Dakota also have not, per reports. The White House announces the president has issued disaster declarations for the states of Wisconsin and Nebraska, bringing the overall count to 36 states, the District of Columbia and four US territories. The declarations are issued as Trump is set to speak at the White House coronavirus task force press briefing, which is due to begin shortly. ESPN reports that Donald Trump hopes to have fans back in stadiums and arenas by August and wants the NFL, America\u2019s most popular sports league, to start as scheduled in September. The president held a conference call with commissioners and leaders from a variety of US sports leagues on Saturday. Professional sports have shut down in the last few weeks as the Covid-19 pandemic has taken hold across America. The NBA was the first league to shut on 11 March, and it was soon followed by MLS and NHL. The start of the baseball season has also been postponed. Health officials have not made it clear whether they find Trump\u2019s timetable realistic, but this summer\u2019s Olympics, which had been due to take place in late July and end in early August have been postponed until 2021. The NFL has previously said it expects to start as scheduled in September in front of fans. California governor Gavin Newsom was asked about Trump\u2019s reported target for NFL season during his daily press briefing in Sacramento, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not anticipating that happening in this state.\u201d \u201cOur decision on that basis at least here in the state of California will be determined by the facts, will be determined by the health experts, will be determined by our capacity to meet this moment, bend the curve and have the appropriate community surveillance and testing to competently determine whether or not that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cRight now I\u2019m just focused on the immediate, but that\u2019s not something I anticipate happening in the next few months.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom said the state\u2019s coronavirus test backlog has been reduced to 13,000 tests pending, down from 60,000 on Friday, during his daily briefing from Sacramento. A total of 126,700 Californians have been tested for the virus, according to the governor. Newsom pointed to the recent peak of 59,500 individuals with results pending in California, admitting: \u201cThe testing space has been a challenging one for us and I own that.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve substantially reduced that backlog,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cA lot of that has to do with the commercial labs stepping up.\u201d The governor also shared California\u2019s updated Covid-19 figures as of Saturday: 2,300 hospitalizations with 1,008 ICU patients (a 10.9% increase over Friday) and 12,026 known cases (a 12.4% increase). He also announced a newly launched website \u2013 covid19supplies.ca.gov \u2013 where citizens can donate or sell personal protective equipment like N95 masks to the state. He said the state has distributed more than 41m N95 masks in addition to other protective gear. \u201cWe are purchasing supplies at scale,\u201d he said. \u201cForty-one million N95 masks we\u2019ve already delivered. We are committed to hundreds of millions more. And that requires diligence, that requires a level of expertise and we can never let speed become the enemy of real results that ultimately deliver on our promise.\u201d Reuters has cited two sources that allege Donald Trump pressed federal officials to make anti-malarial drugs available to treat Covid-19, despite the fact that they were untested on the virus. Reuters reports that the government then took the unusual step of telling doctors they had the option of prescribing the drugs, despite the fact that dosages had not been peer reviewed. \u201cThe president is short-circuiting the process with his gut feelings,\u201d Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School, told Reuters. \u201cWe are in an emergency and we need to rely on our government to ensure that all these potential therapies are tested in the most effective and objective way.\u201d The White House told Reuters that Trump had not launched a \u201cpressure campaign\u201d over the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. \u201cThe President\u2019s top priority is the health and safety of the American people which is why he has brought together the federal government and private sector, including doctors, scientists, and medical researchers, for an unprecedented collaboration to expedite vaccine development,\u201d said the statement. Joe Rogan, host of the hugely popular podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, has said he would vote for Donald Trump over Joe Biden in the presidential election. Rogan gave his views during Friday\u2019s edition of his podcast, which regularly tops the iTunes chart for downloads. During a conversation with his guest Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, talk turned to the upcoming presidential elections. Weinstein said he would not vote for either Trump or Biden, the probable Democratic candidate in November\u2019s election. Rogan said that the Democrats had made \u201cmorons\u201d out of voters by appearing to favour Biden as their candidate. \u201cI\u2019d rather vote for Trump than [Biden],\u201d said Rogan. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can handle anything. You\u2019re relying entirely on his cabinet. If you want to talk about an individual leader who can communicate, he can\u2019t do that. And we don\u2019t know what the fuck he\u2019ll be like after a year in office. \u201cThe pressure of being President of the United States is something that no one has ever prepared for. The only one who seems to be fine with it is Trump, oddly enough. He doesn\u2019t seem to be aging at all or in any sort of decline. Obama, almost immediately, started looking older. George W [Bush], almost immediately, started looking older.\u201d Biden turns 78 in November and Rogan described him as \u201cvery old\u201d and said the senator\u2019s famous verbal slip-ups were \u201cnot a normal way to communicate unless he\u2019s high.\u201d Rogan has previously endorsed Biden\u2019s rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, who is a year older than Biden. \u201cHe\u2019s been insanely consistent his entire life,\u201d said Rogan. \u201cHe\u2019s basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing for his whole life. And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.\u201d The president of the Human Rights Campaign said in January that Sanders should reconsider accepting Rogan\u2019s endorsement due to the fact that the podcaster has \u201cattacked transgender people, gay men, women, people of colour and countless marginalised groups at every opportunity\u201d. A few more details on our earlier post on jails in New York. The city\u2019s jails department said that as of Saturday morning, 305 staff members and 251 incarcerated persons have tested positive for the virus. With regard to the new parole lawsuit, which opposes the automatic jailing of people accused of violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed, the state prisons department, says it\u2019s reviewing the suit and can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. The department said that in response to the circumstances, it is changing longtime policies, and making new ones, to protect those in the prison system, while maintaining public safety. Donald Trump spoke with commissioners and leaders from major US sports leagues and tournaments today. Sports in the US \u2013 and around the world \u2013 have been halted during the pandemic with major consequences for the finances of teams and athletes. Among those present on the conference call with the president were commissioners from the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA and MLS. UFC president Dana White, a long-time ally of Trump was also on the call as was Vince McMahon of WWE. \u201cToday, President Donald J Trump spoke by telephone with commissioners of major league sports to discuss the all-of-America response to Covid-19. The President recognized the good work being done by many teams and players to care for their communities, workforces, and fan bases across the Nation,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \u201cThe commissioners thanked President Trump for his national leadership and for his interest in the sports industry. President Trump encouraged them to continue to support their fellow Americans during this challenging time.\u201d Trump has clashed with several figures from the world of sports during his presidency. He described NFL players who knelt in protest at police brutality as \u201csons of bitches\u201d, while the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors declined to attend the White House for the traditional visit after winning two championships. As coronavirus continues to tear through US jails and prisons, New York civil rights advocates filed a lawsuit Friday opposing the automatic jailing of people accused of parole violations before their alleged infractions can be weighed. Lawyers are demanding an opportunity for the release of more than 1,000 people held in New York City jails \u201cin light of the uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus and the dangerous public health conditions in these facilities.\u201d This Manhattan federal court civil complaint names governor Andrew Cuomo and the state\u2019s top parole official as defendants. New York Civil Liberties Union and The Legal Aid Society explain that the state\u2019s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision must hold a hearing within 90 days to determine an alleged parole violation \u2013 and whether parole should subsequently be revoked. Some of these \u201ctechnical\u201d violations might be something as minor as neglecting to report a new address, change in employment, or missing a parole officer appointment. Several other lawsuits have been filed this week demanding the release of detained parolees from city jails due to Covid-19. For approximately 20% of parole \u201cre-arrests\u201d, these revocation hearings happen after the 90-day period, \u201cand during the coronavirus pandemic these hearings have been suspended almost completely\u201d. \u201cBefore that hearing, there is no opportunity to determine if the person even needs to be in jail simply to wait for that hearing,\u201d advocates say. Because of this dramatic slowdown, people are languishing in jail \u201cindefinitely\u201d \u2013 all the while facing heightened danger from Covid-19. The lawsuit claims that as of Friday, 239 inmates in New York City\u2019s infamous Rikers Island jail have coronavirus. In excess of 2,000 people are now in quarantine units for potential exposure \u2013 approximately 50% of Rikers\u2019 population, advocates say. \u201cAt current rates of infection, the virus\u2019s \u2018attack rate\u2019 in New York jails \u2013 that is, the rate at which the population is being infected \u2013 is 64 times higher than the average in the United States of America and seven times higher than New York City,\u201d the lawsuit maintains. While Cuomo did recently announce that he intends to release up to 600 persons held on technical parole violations due to coronavirus, slightly over 100 have been released as of the lawsuit\u2019s filing, lawyers note. Neither the governor nor state corrections department immediately responded to a request for comment on the federal action. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said the number of Covid-19 cases statewide rose to 34,124 on Saturday at his daily coronavirus briefing in the state capital of Trenton. A total of 846 have died, eclipsing the number of New Jersey lives lost in the 9/11 terror attacks. \u201cWe are today reporting that another 200 residents of passed due to Covid-19 related complications,\u201d he says. \u201cOur state total now sits at 846 precious lives lost. Let me put this in a proper, yet very sobering context. We have now lost nearly 100 more of our fellow New Jerseyans to Covid-19 that we did on the September 11th attacks. Please let that sink in for a moment. This pandemic is writing one of the greatest tragedies in our state\u2019s history and just as we have committed to never forget the lives lost on 9/11, we must commit to never forgetting those we are losing to this pandemic.\u201d He adds: \u201cLet\u2019s just all remember again: this is war. We are in a war. How do you win wars? You don\u2019t panic and you don\u2019t go business-as-usual. You win it by being smart, aggressive, proactive, shooting straight with each other, being honest about the toll that is both before us and will continue to grow. Let\u2019s not kid each other. You win wars by not turning on each other, but to the contrary, coming together. This extraordinary diverse state coming together as one family. \u201cYou win a war because your work harder than the next folks. You win it because you show courage as we\u2019re seeing every single day up and down this state, from our frontline healthcare workers, to every single one of the nine million of us, including folks right now at home by themselves doing exactly what we need. Every single one of us is a hero right now. Every single one of us must do our part if we are to flatten the curve of this virus, allow our healthcare system to be able to deal with it properly and then emerge on the other side. And unequivocally may I say, if we all do our part, there is no question in my mind we will win this war and we will emerge from it stronger as one New Jersey family, more together than ever before.\u201d Adam Schiff, chair of the House intelligence committee, said Donald Trump is \u201cdecapitating the leadership of the intelligence community in the middle of a national crisis\u201d and \u201csettling scores\u201d after the president fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the US intelligence community, late on Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d Schiff said during an interview on MSNBC on Saturday. \u201cAnd of course it sends a message throughout the federal government and in particular to other inspectors general that if they do their job as this professional did and Michael Atkinson was a complete professional, they too may be fired by a vindictive president.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Schiff\u2019s alarm, calling the firing of the Trump appointee \u201ca brazen act against a patriotic public servant who has honorably performed his duty\u201d. Here\u2019s a bit more on New York\u2019s ventilator hunt from our health reporter: Chinese billionaires and the state of Oregon facilitated ventilator donations to New York to treat patients with Covid-19, as the pandemic accelerates toward a peak. New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced the state obtained 1,000 ventilators from billionaires Joseph and Clara Tsai and Alibaba founder Jack Ma, while President Trump again promoted an unproven malaria drug as treatment for Covid-19 on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the apex,\u201d said Cuomo, who described that crescendo of cases as, \u201cthe number one point of engagement of the enemy.\u201d In addition to the 1,000 ventilators obtained from China, Cuomo said Oregon loaned New York 140 ventilators. Current projections put the peak of the pandemic anywhere between four and 14 days away. Officials hope physical distancing imposed across the state will slow the spread of the disease, and forestall the possibility of running out of ventilators and beds, even as Cuomo admitted he hoped to see the apex soon so the experience would end. The pandemic, \u201cstresses this country, this state, in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime,\u201d Cuomo said. The briefing was another contrast in leadership between Cuomo and Trump. Where Cuomo\u2019s briefings have alarming statistics, his frank descriptions of shortages and personal struggles have been praised across the country. On Saturday, Cuomo said the state had a signed contract for 17,000 ventilators, which he was later told could not be filled because many had already been purchased by China. Justin Trudeau, speaking at his daily Covid-19 briefing, says Canada won\u2019t bring retaliatory measures against the United States after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks. The Associated Press reports: Trudeau says he will speak to President Trump in the coming days. He says his officials are having constructive conversations with American officials. Trudeau says he will tell Trump both countries are interlinked in ways that it would damage both if supply chains are cut. The prime minister says Canada ships gloves and testing kits to the U.S and notes materials from the N95 masks originate in Canada. Canadian nurses also cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system everyday. Manufacturing giant 3M says there are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing N95 masks to health care workers in Canada and Latin America, where 3M is a critical supplier of respirators. Cuomo has finished his daily briefing from Albany, where he warned the hardest days lie ahead for the state that\u2019s become the central hotbed of the pandemic in the United States. \u201cIf there was anything I could do to accelerate getting it over, I would,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways I want to get to that apex. I want to get on the other side of that apex and let\u2019s just slide down that mountain. On the other hand we have to be ready for the fight and we have to handle that fight. And that\u2019s where we are. \u201cSo what do we do? You have to get to through it. There is no simple answer here. You\u2019re not going to wish this away. You have to get through it and you have to get through it intelligently, saving as many lives as you can. And that\u2019s hard work and that\u2019s perseverance and that\u2019s mutuality and that\u2019s community and that\u2019s finding your better self and that\u2019s finding your inner strength and dealing with a situation that is almost unmanageable on every level, because you are out of control. \u201cAnd this is a painful, disorienting experience. \u201cBut we find our best self, our strongest self [and] this day will end and we will get through it and we will get to the other side of the mountain and we will be the better for it. But we have to do what we have to do between now and then and that\u2019s just what we doing here.\u201d Cuomo says the number of hospitalizations on Long Island has grown exponentially in the last few days, saying he doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because city residents are fleeing or seeking treatment there. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for the past few days, watch Long Island, because it\u2019s like a fire, spreading,\u201d he says. Cases in Long Island\u2019s Nassau County are at 13,346 (up 1,322 from yesterday), the second-highest in the state. Suffolk County cases are at 11,370 (up 1,216 from yesterday). While Andrew Cuomo is speaking in New York, Trump has continued to be busy on Twitter, mostly retweeting but adding comments of his own. To wit: The president\u2019s belief in the possibility that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, might be an effective treatment for Covid-19 is not shared with his leading public health experts on the White House task force. On Fox News on Friday, infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said: \u201cWe still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective. But when you don\u2019t have that information, it\u2019s understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective.\u201d All this, of course, does not stop Trump returning to the well on Twitter and at White House briefings. Here\u2019s Oliver Milman\u2019s look at the issue: The president carries on: It often pays to check who Trump is retweeting. John Solomon, it should be noted, is a columnist whose work for The Hill was used in attempts to smear opponents of the president during the Ukraine affair which led to Trump\u2019s impeachment. Trump has obviously been scrolling down Solomon\u2019s profile page this morning: Late on Friday night, Trump made his latest move against a leader of the intelligence community, in this case one who played a key role in the impeachment process: Cuomo says that the Chinese government will facilitate a donation of 1,000 ventilators to arrive into JFK airport today, saying: \u201cThis is a big deal and it\u2019s going to make a significant difference for us.\u201d He\u2019s pressed on the impending reality that New York will not have enough ventilators for admissions, which will require two patients on the same ventilator. \u201cSplitting is not ideal,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to war with what you have, not with what you need.\u201d The state of Oregon is sending 140 ventilators to New York, Cuomo says, calling it \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cunexpected\u201d. \u201cI want this all to be over,\u201d the governor says. \u201cIt\u2019s only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime. I think we all feel the same. This stresses this country, this state in a way nothing else has frankly in my lifetime. It stresses us on every love. The economy is stressed, the social fabric is stressed, social systems are stressed, transportation is stressed. It\u2019s right across the board. But the most difficult level is the human level. It is for me, anyway. And it\u2019s every day and it\u2019s everywhere.\u201d He adds: \u201cYou can\u2019t even quantify the effect on society and the effect on individuals and the burden that we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo opens Saturday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing with the latest numbers: Covid-19 cases in New York City: 63,606 (up 6,147 from Friday) Covid-19 cases in New York state: 113,704 (up 10,841 from Friday) Total people tested (283,621) Total people hospitalized: 15,905 (up 1,095 from yesterday) Total ICU admissions: 4,126 (up 395 from yesterday) A woman is Florida is seeking to gain sole custody of her two-year-old son during the Covid-19 pandemic because the boy\u2019s father works in the emergency services. According to court papers, Tabatha Sams currently shares custody with her son\u2019s father, Stephen Thilmony, who is a firefighter and emergency medicine technician. Thilmony\u2019s fiancee, meanwhile, is an emergency room nurse. \u201cAs Covid-19 has spread throughout the United States, medical professionals and first responders have been subjected to coronavirus at a higher rate, due to their increased exposure to individuals testing positive for the virus,\u201d Sams said in the court papers. In the papers, Thilmony is quoted as saying he is not endangering his son. \u201cWe are taking proper measures to protect ourselves and him,\u201d Thilmony said. The Daily Show has put together clips of politicians and media figures giving their views on Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic. Let\u2019s just say some of the quotes have not aged well: There has been plenty of concern about the potential for mass casualties in US jails during the Covid-19 pandemic. A public health expert has also warned outbreaks that start in jails could pose risks for the wider community. \u201cThe prison population in and of itself has a fairly sizable, vulnerable population within that, have a lot of chronic conditions, other types of infections,\u201d Dr Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, told CNN. \u201cWe should also ensure that what happens in a prison, or a jail for that matter, does not pose an undue risk to the community. In this case, we know we have ample examples from many infectious diseases.\u201d As fatalities rise in the United States, the shortage of space to store bodies is becoming a concern. It\u2019s a problem that authorities had to confront in countries hit by the Covid-19 epidemic earlier than the US: for example, in Spain a Madrid ice rink was used to store bodies before burial. Med Alliance Group, a medical distributor in Illinois, has reported being inundated with requests for refrigerated trailers. \u201cThey\u2019re coming from all over: From hospitals, health systems, coroner\u2019s offices, VA facilities, county and state health departments, state emergency departments and funeral homes,\u201d Christie Penzol, a spokeswoman for Med Alliance, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s heart-wrenching.\u201d Penzol added that the company has already rented out all its trailers and there is an 18-week wait for the materials needed to build new ones. Fox News host Sean Hannity hit back against intense criticism of the conservative network\u2019s coronavirus coverage, even claiming in a new interview that he was ahead of most media in taking Covid-19 seriously. Hannity\u2019s statements to Newsweek were in response to a 1 April open letter signed by 74 journalism professors that lambasted Fox News for allegedly spreading \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the outbreak. The professors\u2019 missive directly cited Hannity\u2019s statement that the Democrats and media overplayed coronavirus to \u201cbludgeon Trump with this new hoax.\u201d Their letter came several days before a report in The Daily Beast that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan were bracing for lawsuits over Fox News\u2019s coronavirus coverage. Asked about his statement that Democrats and the media were using Covid-19 \u201cto bludgeon Trump,\u201d Hannity responded, \u201cMany of them did.\u201d \u201cWe are in the middle of the huge pandemic and where\u2019s the Democrat saying, \u2018You know, I didn\u2019t agree with the travel ban at the time, but it was the right decision.\u2019 Politics trumps truth in their world.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same Democrats, media mob and liberal professors who are so lazy they won\u2019t even look at what I\u2019ve said about the virus. They just go with their narrative. I never called it a \u2018hoax,\u2019\u201d Hannity said when subsequently asked about his \u201choax\u201d comment. \u201cI said it was a hoax for them to be using it as a bludgeon on Trump. And they are. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are talking about an investigation. Now? In the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Hannity also said \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d The letter, addressed to both Murdoch and his son, claimed \u201cviewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network \u2013 false statements downplaying the prevalence of Covid-19 and its harms\u2026\u201d The professors further claimed that Fox News offered \u201cmisleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.\u201d Mediaite pointed out that while Fox News has taken some actions that seemingly view coronavirus more seriously \u2013 with Hannity and other talking heads such as Tucker Carlson appearing in a PSA, for example \u2013 there have still been questionable moments. On Friday night, Carlson criticized infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s call for a national stay-at-home mandate. \u201cMore than 10 million Americans have already lost their jobs. Imagine another year of this. That would be national suicide, and yet, that is what Anthony Fauci is suggesting, at least,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cNow, we\u2019re not suggesting that Fauci wants to hurt America. We don\u2019t think he does, he seems like a very decent man. But Fauci is not an economist or for that matter someone who fears being unemployed himself. Like most of the people around him.\u201d Probable Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has issued a statement calling for Donald Trump to appoint a \u201csupply commander\u201d to \u201cco-ordinate critical materials for all 50 states and US territories\u201d. Biden has been seeking a call with Trump to discuss the coronavirus response. No word that it\u2019s happened yet. Marc Caputo of Politico, meanwhile, makes a wry point: MSNBC host Rachel Maddow called for essentially the same thing last night. Here\u2019s some further reading: Washington bureau chief David Smith again \u2013 busy lad \u2013 with a look at where the 2020 election stands with the nation in the grip of Covid-19: Biden finds himself holed up in his basement in Wilmington, Delaware, struggling to break into the national conversation through TV interviews and virtual campaign events. Trump has been denied the lifeblood of rallies but switched to his other favourite medium \u2013 television \u2013 with daily coronavirus taskforce briefings from the White House. Polls suggest he is benefiting moderately from a \u201crally around the flag effect\u201d Still no sign of the president, whose thumbs would often have twitched towards his iPhone by this time of a Saturday. Over at the Washington Post, meanwhile, media columnist Margaret Sullivan has an interesting take this morning on Andrew and Chris Cuomo\u2019s developing coronavirus double act, in which the New York governor and his CNN anchor (and Covid-19 patient) brother regularly conduct interviews full of endearing brotherly bickering. \u201cNot everyone approves of the Cuomo Brothers show,\u201d Sullivan writes. This is something I cannot wrap my head around,\u201d Fabian Reinbold, Washington bureau chief for a large German news organization, told me in an email this week. \u201cIt would be considered highly inappropriate and corrupt back home.\u201d He was particularly taken aback by Chris Cuomo\u2019s choice to actually participate in Thursday\u2019s [New York governor\u2019s] news conference, piped in via videoconference to hold forth to the gathered press corps. He wore a baseball cap emblazoned with the name of his CNN show, \u201cCuomo Primetime,\u201d further blurring the roles of brother and anchor. That moment may have proved too much for competitors Fox News and MSNBC, who cut away from the New York governor\u2019s briefing soon after. Others have questioned the journalistic propriety of repeatedly interviewing one\u2019s brother on prime-time TV, as Chris Cuomo has been doing for weeks. Jon Allsop at Columbia Journalism Review, for one, disapproves. He reasonably suggests a less fraught approach: \u201cThere are plenty of ways Chris Cuomo could communicate about his health with CNN viewers while also taking time to recuperate. While he\u2019s out, a colleague could talk with his brother.\u201d All that said, Sullivan also points out that in a nation grown used to the open nepotism of the Trump administration, where the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law double as his chief advisers, perhaps the Cuomo Show is relatively small beer. It also seems necessary to say, again, that it really is quite endearing: Good morning and welcome to another day of US coronavirus coverage. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, there are have now been nearly 278,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and more than 7,000 deaths. That toll will no doubt rise today. We\u2019ll expect to hear from New York governor Andrew Cuomo, about conditions in the state worst hit by far. Those Johns Hopkins figures put confirmed cases in New York at around 103,000 and deaths at nearly 3,000. Here\u2019s Daniel Strauss\u2019s look at how Cuomo has navigated the crisis, relations with Donald Trump and a national spotlight which has also landed on his younger brother Chris Cuomo, a CNN anchor who was this week found to have contracted Covid-19. There is also a White House briefing due at the earlier-than-usual time of 3.30pm ET, which is 8.30pm UK. On Friday, Donald Trump made his usual round of headlines at the briefing room podium, not least by announcing new federal guidelines that say people should wear face masks in public, which his wife Melania tweeted out as he spoke, but then saying he was not going to do so. The president also attacked reporters, criticised Cuomo over his appeals for ventilators to fight an expected surge in New York cases, and defended his son-in-law Jared Kushner for comments about the federal healthcare equipment stockpile at the briefing the day before. Ed Pilkington, our chief reporter, has another in-depth read about Trump\u2019s struggle to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s here: There\u2019s been no word from Trump on Twitter yet this morning but there\u2019s always time for that to change. For some further reading as this Saturday begins, here\u2019s a key quote from Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s fascinating interview with Jon Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent and a long-term Trump foil whose new book, obviously written before the pandemic, is called Front Row at the Trump Show: We\u2019re at a point where nearly half the country doesn\u2019t believe what this president and White House says and we have nearly half the rest of the country that\u2019s been told not to believe what they see in a newspaper or see in television news or any other form of mainstream news. \u201cThat\u2019s a deeply troubling, deeply dangerous place to be where there isn\u2019t a shared agreement and sense of some basic facts, especially now where reliable information, and believing you have reliable information, can literally be a matter of life and death.\u201d More, as they say, follows. Here\u2019s David\u2019s piece in full:",

(Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be <strong><em>our</em></strong><em> </em>stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d)<strong><br></strong></p> \n  <p>Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states. But out of that we choose oftentimes, as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock...we are going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says \u2018our\u2019 he is talking about \u201cour country\u201d he is talking about the federal government. You should be ashamed of yourself...don\u2019t make it sound bad...you just asked your question in a very nasty way.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In fact, yesterday reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read.</p> \n  <p>But this morning, that language had been <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2020%2Fapr%2F03%2Fcoronavirus-live-news-us-donald-trump-latest%3Fpage%3Dwith%3Ablock-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4%23block-5e878d5d8f08c35a1d119ae4\">removed</a> from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T23:47:40.191Z\">at 12.47am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e87bbc98f08c9eaf0dae380\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-03T22:51:33.316Z\">11.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Fact check: Mail-in voting</strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cA lot of people cheat\u201d with mail-in voting, Trump said.

The president undermined the guidelines almost immediately after announcing them, insisting that he wouldn\u2019t wear masks because \u201cthey\u2019re not for me\u201d. During the daily coronavirus task force briefing, Donald Trump attacked the idea of voting by mail, despite having requested an absentee ballot in 2020. The president said, citing no evidence, that mail-in voting encouraged cheating. Asked whether he could reassure New Yorkers that the state would receive enough ventilators, the president said, \u201cNo.\u201d. The state is seeking 15,000 ventilators before the peak of cases hits. Today, New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll, with nearly 3,000 residents having already lost their lives. Nancy Pelosi said Congress should pass another economic relief bill. The House speaker said Congress should build upon the $2tn stimulus package passed last month. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% last month, according to the US jobs report released this morning. Economists expect that figure to rise steeply as more companies lay off workers amid the pandemic. The supreme court announced it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month. The court had already delayed cases that were scheduled to be argued in March. Congressman Adam Schiff drafted a bill to establish a commission to probe the coronavirus response. The Democratic lawmaker said the commission would seek to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. And here\u2019s a roundup of the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage from across the country: 1) In California, food banks are struggling to keep up with growing demand, even as they run into volunteer shortages and rising food prices. 2) In Michigan, a public bus driver died less than two weeks after expressing concern about passenger coughing without covering her mouth. 3) In New York, workers at Bellevue hospital, which has fought against epidemics for centuries, say they can see a breaking point coming as coronavirus cases rise. 4) In Florida, passengers from an ill-fated cruise were carefully freed from their cabins and allowed to touch dry land. Here\u2019s a round-up of Guardian opinion pieces, to help you digest this week in politics: 1) Lloyd Green on Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law as public health adviser... 2) David Heymann on face masks... 3) Heidi Shierholz on the economy... 4) And finally, The Guardian view on Trump\u2019s coronavirus response... Here\u2019s more from the reporter who Trump attacked during the briefing. The president told Weijia Jiang of CBS that she \u201coughtta be ashamed\u201d for asking what the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner meant when he said that the federal stockpile was \u201cours\u201d. The president has habitually lashed out at reporters of color, and particularly women. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith has also found that the pattern extends to lawmakers and public figures of color. My colleague Sam Levine circles back to the moment during today\u2019s coronavirus briefing when Trump bashed the idea of voting by mail... As Donald Trump was explaining that he won\u2019t be wearing a mask, because he doesn\u2019t want to greet \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings queens,\u201d with his face covered, Melania Trump tweeted an appeal for \u201ceveryone\u201d to take the CDC guidelines seriously: I missed this moment, from earlier, when Trump discusses models: Well, that\u2019s all the briefing we\u2019re getting today. My colleague Joanna Walters has one last fact check for us: Fact check: the federal stockpile A reporter at the White House briefing asked Trump why Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, referred to \u201cour stockpile\u201d yesterday when asked about states struggling to get key medical supplies, especially ventilators, from the federal government. (Kushner had said: \u201cThe notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d) Trump just gave a very confusing response, saying: \u201cYou know what \u2018our\u2019 means? The United States of America. Our, our, and then we take that \u2018our\u2019 and we distribute it to the states.\u201d The reporter responded: \u201cSo why did he say it\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles?\u201d Trump: \u201cBecause we need it for the government, we need it for the federal government. To keep for our country because the federal government needs it, too, not just the states. But out of that we choose oftentimes, as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock...we are going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says \u2018our\u2019 he is talking about \u201cour country\u201d he is talking about the federal government. You should be ashamed of yourself...don\u2019t make it sound bad...you just asked your question in a very nasty way.\u201d In fact, yesterday reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website. \u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read. But this morning, that language had been removed from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d Fact check: Mail-in voting \u201cA lot of people cheat\u201d with mail-in voting, Trump said. People should go to the voting booth, \u201cproudly display yourself\u201d and have an ID, he added. \u201cAll sorts of bad things can happen\u201d, when people vote by mail, the president said. But there is no evidence of widespread cheating when people vote by mail, and on the contrary, there is evidence that removing barriers to voting by mail can make it easier for many people \u2013 including those with disabilities, and work and childcare responsibilities \u2013 to vote. Still, Trump has long-opposed measures to expand vote by mail. My colleague Sam Levine reported earlier this week: Donald Trump admitted on Monday that making it easier to vote in America would hurt the Republican party. The president made the comments as he dismissed a Democratic-led push for reforms such as vote-by-mail, same-day registration and early voting as states seek to safely run elections amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats had proposed the measures as part of the coronavirus stimulus. They ultimately were not included in the $2.2tn final package, which included only $400m to states to help them run elections. \u201cThe things they had in there were crazy. They had things, levels of voting that if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d Trump said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends. \u201cThey had things in there about election days and what you do and all sorts of clawbacks. They had things that were just totally crazy and had nothing to do with workers that lost their jobs and companies that we have to save.\u201d Fact check: Is the previous administration to blame? Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the \u201cprevious administration\u201d for his government\u2019s lack of preparation for the coronavirus crisis. \u201cSpeak to the people from the previous administration. The shelves were empty,\u201d he said when asked why the US failed to stockpile enough medical supplies to meet current needs. But Trump, who has been president since 2017, ignored early warnings that a pandemic was coming, including from his own HHS secretary. Three months before the first cases of coronavirus began spreading through China, the Trump administration ended a $200m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics. Will the government guarantee that New York will have enough ventilators? \u201cNo,\u201d the Trump said. \u201cWe are doing the best we can... We happen to think [governor Andrew Cuomo] is well served with ventilators. We are going to find out.\u201d Trump added that other states like Michigan and Louisiana made need ventilators, too. We found Dr Fauci... He\u2019s on PBS NewsHour, providing context and guidance on the new mask guidelines. Context: Antibody tests Dr Deborah Birx said that tests that can detect whether people have had the infection and developed immunity will be important going forward. \u201cWe want those tests to be like what we use for HIV and Malaria,\u201d she said, which uses a finger prick of blood to detect whether a person\u2019s immune system has developed antibodies to fight the infection. Yesterday, the FDA approved an antibody test that is more complicated, and requires a lot more than just a finger-prick of blood. The test, developed by Cellex, takes 15 to 20 minutes to get a result. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told me yesterday because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said. Trump is growing increasingly hostile toward reporters in the briefing room. Asked to clarify what the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner meant when he said the national stockpile was \u201cour stockpile\u201d and not for states, Trump snapped that she \u201coughtta be ashamed\u201d of herself. \u201cWe need it for the federal government,\u201d he said, of the national emergency stockpile. He\u2019s repeatedly said that states should depend on the federal government for aid unless it\u2019s a \u201clast resort\u201d and has blamed states for a shortage of medical supplies. Context: Oracle and Covid-19 treatments Trump said, \u201cmany providers are trying different experimental treatments.\u201d The health secretary Alex Azar added: \u201cToday, Oracle has developed and donated to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced and real-time information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics.\u201d As the New York Times reported on 24 March: The White House is preparing to use software provided by the technology giant Oracle to promote unproven coronavirus treatments, including a pair of malaria drugs publicized by Trump, potentially before the government approves their use for the outbreak, according to five senior administration officials and others familiar with the plans. An online platform designed by Oracle, in collaboration with the White House, is still taking shape, but it is likely to be used to collect information about off-label use of the drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Trump has tried to reassure Americans that what he has called a \u201cgame changer\u201d treatment is imminent, but his language has alarmed senior health officials and public health experts, who say that the Oracle program would amount to a sprawling, crowdsourced clinical trial without the usual controls of the FDA. The president boasted about his administration\u2019s shipments of medical masks to New York. Compared to the homemade masks that the CDC is reccomending that the public wear, the N-95 masks are \u201cmore expensive, more complicated, better, whatever\u201d, Trump said. Why is it we don\u2019t have enough masks? \u201cThe previous administration,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSpeak to the people from the previous administration. The shelves were empty.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Trump in response to a question asking where Dr Anthony Fauci is today. Fauci, Trump\u2019s leading public health adviser, has jot joined in the briefing today. \u201cWhenever he\u2019s not here,\u201d Trump complained, \u201cthe fake news\u201d will ask about him. The masks are more for the protection of other people than oneself, the surgeon general clarified Jerome Adams. Wearing a cloth face covering will help contain your coughs and sneezes, reducing chances that you\u2019ll spray infectious droplets into the air, and risk transmitting the disease the others, noted Dr Adams. Still \u201cmaintaining 6ft of social distancing remains key\u201d, he said. Masks are \u201cnot a replacement for social distancing\u201d. Also important: don\u2019t put a mask on with dirty hands. \u201cIf you choose to wear a face covering, wash your hands first,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI won\u2019t be doing it, personally,\u201d Trump said about masks - it wouldn\u2019t suit his position. He doesn\u2019t want to greet world leaders, \u201cpresidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens\u201d, he continued, while wearing a face covering. \u201cI don\u2019t know, somehow, I don\u2019t see it for myself.\u201d Here\u2019s more from the CDC: \u201cCDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (eg, grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission\u201d People should continue to maintain a 6ft distance between themselves and others, and remain diligent about washing and sanitizing hands. All Americans, including those without health insurance, will be able to receive treatment without worrying about the cost, according to Mike Pence. The administration has repeatedly ignored calls from Democratic lawmakers to reopen the Obamacare exchanges to allow the uninsured to purchase insurance. Instead, Pence said that hospitals that treat uninsured would get paid for at Medicare rates. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure, \u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s looking like good results,\u201d he said. But public health experts including Trump\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Fauci, have previously warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. My colleague Oliver Milman reported that a French study of 40 coronavirus patients found that half experienced clearing of their airways after being given hydroxychloroquine. Experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has reportedly caused stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine. White House aide Judd Deere provided more clarification: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends masks for the public, Trump said, though Trump repeatedly undermined the recommendation. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. Donald Trump has taken the podium. New York City residents all received a push alert, calling on all licensed healthcare workers to support facilities in need. My colleague Alexandra Villarreal reported, earlier: New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, has called for a national enlistment program for doctors and nurses, to handle an expected surge in coronavirus cases in New York and across the US. \u201cIf we\u2019re fighting a war, let\u2019s act like we\u2019re fighting a war,\u201d he said. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. Soon, we\u2019re expecting Donald Trump to speak at the daily coronavirus briefing at 5:30. Alabama has just issued a stay at home order for the entire state, starting at 5pm Saturday. Governor Kay Ivey issued the order after initially resisting calls. The state has reported more than 1,400 cases of coronavirus. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Nancy Pelosi said Congress should pass another economic relief bill. The House speaker said Congress should build upon the $2 trillion stimulus package passed last month to help Americans who are struggling financially because of coronavirus. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% last month, according to the US jobs report released this morning. Economists expect that figure to rise steeply as more companies lay off workers amid the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is signing an executive order to redistribute respirators to hospitals in need. New York reported the largest single-day increase in its coronavirus death toll, with nearly 3,000 residents having already lost their lives. The Supreme Court announced it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month. The court had already delayed cases that were scheduled to be argued in March. Congressman Adam Schiff drafted a bill to establish a commission to probe the coronavirus response. The Democratic lawmaker said the commission would seek to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers is calling on lawmakers to cancel in-person voting for the state\u2019s presidential primary on Tuesday. Evers expressed fear that primary voters could spread coronavirus at polling places if they are asked to cast ballots in person. The Democratic governor called on legislators to hold a special session tomorrow to make the primary an entirely mail-in election. \u201cThis is a significant concern and a very unnecessary public health risk,\u201d Evers told reporters. \u201cI can\u2019t move this election or change it on my own. My hands are tied.\u201d Wisconsin has already seen a surge in requests for mail-in ballots. Wisconsin Democrats and civil rights have also sued the state to get officials to loosen requirements for absentee voting. The Supreme Court has said it will postpone oral arguments scheduled for this month because of the pandemic. Reuters reports: The court, which already had delayed cases due to be argued in March, has yet to say how it will proceed. The court\u2019s current term is due to conclude at the end of June. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said that the nine justices - including oldest member Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87 - are all healthy. The court is due to issue rulings online only on Monday, as it has in the last two weeks. The governor of Pennsylvania is asking all state residents to wear face masks if they go outside. The recommendation from governor Tom Wolf comes amid some conflicting messages about whether all Americans should be wearing face coverings. Health officials originally said widespread mask usage would not help mitigate the spread of the virus, but that thinking appears to be changing as early evidence indicates coronavirus can be spread even through talking. The White House is expected to soon issue federal guidance on all Americans wearing face coverings. Lawmakers from both parties criticized the reported barriers that small businessowners are experiencing as they try to receive funds from the stimulus package. Applications opened today for the $350 billion small business loan program that was estblished in the $2 trillion stimulus package, but some businessowners said they were being blocked from applying to certain banks. Republican senator Marco Rubio specifically criticized Bank of America for its requirements of loan applicants. Democratic senator Ben Cardin similarly accused banks of \u201ccreating artificial barriers\u201d that block much-needed funds from reaching struggling businesses. \u201cThe small business provisions in the CARES Act were written to get funds into the hands of American small business owners as quickly as possible so they can keep employees on payroll and avoid financial ruin while we work to combat COVID-19,\u201d Cardin said in a statement. \u201cCreating artificial barriers that block businesses from much-needed capital is redlining by another name.\u201d Meanwhile, the Small Business Administration said that more than $2 billion in loans have already been processed through the program. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports on the latest from California: California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, has announced that the state has now secured 7,000 hotel rooms for homeless people during the pandemic, with the goal of procuring 15,000 total. At a briefing in Sacramento, he also said the state now has 10,710 total positive Covid-19 cases, 2,188 people hospitalized, and 901 in the ICU (a 10.4% hike from yesterday). Newsom said the federal government would cover 75% of the costs of hotels through Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) reimbursement. He said 869 people total have been housed through the state program so far, and that the rooms are for people who have tested positive, been exposed or are high risk. \u201cWe want to relieve the stress in our shelter system so we can separate individuals and relieve the impact on our medical delivery system,\u201d the governor said, standing outside a facility where 30 homeless people have now been housed. There are questions about whether the state\u2019s efforts to prevent major outbreaks in homeless communities will be fast enough and at a large enough scale. More than 150,000 people are homeless in the state, with an estimated 40,000 in crowded shelters on a given night where there are major concerns about potential spread. Some previous reporting on the subject: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell celebrated House speaker Nancy Pelosi shifting her focus away from a massive infrastructure bill. The Kentucky Republican said Pelosi had been trying \u201cto use this crisis to push unrelated left-wing priorities,\u201d even though Trump himseld voiced support for an infrastructure bill. Pelosi released a statement earlier today saying the next coronavirus bill should focus on economic relief, expanding upon the $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law last month, as the country confronts mass job losses. \u201cWhile I\u2019m very much in favor of doing some things we need to do to meet the needs \u2014 clean water, more broadband, the rest of that \u2014 that may have to be for a bill beyond this,\u201d Pelosi told CNBC earlier today. The description of the Strategic National Stockpile on a government website was changed after Jared Kushner mischaracterized the program. Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, said yesterday, \u201cAnd the notion of the federal stockpile was it\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile. It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d Reporters quickly noted the stockpile is indeed meant as a resource for the states, as noted on the department of health and human services\u2019 website. \u201cWhen state, local, tribal, and territorial responders request federal assistance to support their response efforts, the stockpile ensures that the right medicines and supplies get to those who need them most during an emergency,\u201d the website read. But this morning, that language had been removed from the HHS website. \u201cThe Strategic National Stockpile\u2019s role is to supplement state and local supplies during public health emergencies,\u201d the website now says. \u201cMany states have products stockpiled, as well.\u201d News outlets were quick to note the change, but the agency said the language revision was in the works for weeks, a claim that was met with much skepticism on Twitter. The actual coronavirus death toll in Wuhan, China, may have exceeded 40,000, according to estimates based on the activity of the region\u2019s funeral homes. The official death toll in Wuhan, the first region to experience an outbreak of coronavirus, is 2,563. The Washington Post reports: The Hankou Funeral Parlor\u2019s crematorium was operating 19 hours a day, with male staff enlisted to help carry bodies. In just two days, the home received 5,000 urns, the respected magazine Caixin reported. ... Using photos posted online, social media sleuths have estimated that Wuhan funeral homes had returned 3,500 urns a day since March 23. That would imply a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 \u2014 or 16 times the official number. Another widely shared calculation, based on Wuhan\u2019s 84 furnaces running nonstop and each cremation taking an hour, put the death toll at 46,800. The US intelligence community has reportedly concluded that China under-reported coronavirus cases and deaths. Health experts have similarly said the death tolls in Italy and Spain suggest China may not have reported all of its data on the virus. The White House is stepping up its precautions to ensure the president and vice president don\u2019t get coronavirus. The AP reports: Starting Friday, anyone who is expected to be in \u2018close proximity\u2019 to either President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence will be given a quick COVID-19 test \u2018to evaluate for pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers status to limit inadvertent transmission.\u2019 ... All visitors to the White House complex already have their temperatures taken when entering the building and if they will be in close proximity to either Trump or Pence. Trump took the new COVID-19 test on Thursday and the White House doctor said results were back in 15 minutes. He tested negative. Trump and Pence were both tested for coronavirus themselves last month, after they both came into contact with individuals who later tested positive. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy raised the possibility of delaying the state\u2019s presidential primary, which is currently set for early June. \u201cI\u2019ll be stunned if we stay at June 2,\u201d Murphy said. Eleven primaries are currently set to be held on June 2, after several states delayed their April and May primaries in order to avoid spreading coronavirus at polling places. But if New Jersey pushes its primary past June 2, it will likely put pressure on those other states to follow suit. The Democratic National Committee similarly announced yesterday that its convention, originally scheduled to start July 13, would be delayed a month because ofthe pandemic. Joe Biden applauded a Navy captain who was dismissed from his post after raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship. Brett Crozier was relieved from his post as captain of the the USS Theodore Roosevelt yesterday after a letter he wrote to senior officials, which demanded crew members be allowed to quarantine, was made public. \u201cWe are not at war,\u201d Crozier wrote in the letter. \u201cSailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors.\u201d The acting Navy secretary said Crozier had shown \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by sending the letter outside his chain of command, but Biden applauded the captain\u2019s courage and loyalty. Videos shared on social media last night showed hundreds of crew members cheering for Crozier as he departed from the ship. Early data on coronavirus cases and deaths indicates that in the US, African Americans are being worst affected by the pandemic. ProPublica reports: As of Friday morning, African Americans made up almost half of Milwaukee County\u2019s 945 cases and 81% of its 27 deaths in a county whose population is 26% black. Milwaukee is one of the few places in the United States that is tracking the racial breakdown of people who have been infected by the novel coronavirus, offering a glimpse at the disproportionate destruction it is inflicting on black communities nationwide. In Michigan, where the state\u2019s population is 14% black, African Americans made up 35% of cases and 40% of deaths as of Friday morning. Detroit, where a majority of residents are black, has emerged as a hot spot with a high death toll. As has New Orleans. Louisiana has not published case breakdowns by race, but 40% of the state\u2019s deaths have happened in Orleans Parish, where the majority of residents are black.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said there will be \u201cglitches\u201d with distributing funds from the stimulus package. \u201cThere are bound to be problems,\u201d McConnell told McClatchy. \u201cYou can\u2019t pass a bill of this magnitude in a week and have a perfect implementation of $2.2 trillion, so sure there are going to be glitches.\u201d McConnell\u2019s comments come as banks report a flood of applicatnts for the small business loan program, which started accepting applications today, and Americans await their direct cash payments. According to a memo House Democrats are reportedly ciculating, some Americans may not receive their payments for nearly five months, a disappointing timeline considering nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment in the past two weeks. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said $875 million in small business loans have already been processed as part of the Paycheck Protection Program created by the $2 trillion stimulus package. That $875 million represents a small fraction of the $349 billion the program, which began accepting application today, is expected to distribute. Some major banks are already reporting a flood of applications that raised concerns about how small businesses would be able to quickly receive the much-needed funds. Bank of America said it received 10,000 applications by 10 am ET, and some banks have not even opened their application portals yet. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has issued a statement calling for another bill to build on the $2 trillion stimulus package to help Americans who are suffering financially during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe acceleration of the coronavirus demands that we double down on the downpayment we made in CARES by passing a CARES 2 package,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cWe must extend and expand this bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of the American people.\u201d The Democratic speaker called for more direct payments to American families, additional funding to process unemployment claims and resources for the overwhelmed healthcare system. The statement comes one day after the labor department announced nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks. \u201cThe coronavirus is moving swiftly, and our communities cannot afford for us to wait,\u201d Pelosi said. The speaker added that Demorats will also continue working on a potential infrastructure package, which she has referred to as \u201cphase four\u201d of Congress\u2019 coronavirus response. CNN host Brooke Baldwin said she has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second CNN host this week to announce a diagnosis. \u201cI am OKAY,\u201d Baldwin wrote on Instagram, noting she has no underlying conditions to complicate her illness. \u201cIt came on suddenly yesterday afternoon. Chills, aches, fever.\u201d CNN host Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, announced earlier this week that he had also been diagnosed with the virus. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order to seize ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases. The order, which will allow the state to redistribute ventilators to overwhelmed hospitals, comes as New York reported its highest single-day increase yet in the coronavirus death toll. Congressman Adam Schiff has drafted a bill to form a commission to probe the coronavirus response. Schiff said the purpose of the commission would to gather lessons for future crises, but Trump dismissed the idea of a commission yesterday as a Democratic \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% as the US reported 701,000 job losses. The figure is only expected to rise in the coming months, with the Congressional Budget Office predicting unemployment will surpass 10% this financial quarter. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Stephanie Kirchgaessner reports: The removal of a US naval captain who expressed alarm over sailors on his ship because of the threat of the Covid-19 virus may have violated whistleblower protection laws, according to a lawyer who has studied the issue. Captain Brett Crozier was relieved of his command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt days after a letter he wrote, which had warned that an outbreak of the virus aboard the aircraft carrier could lead to deaths, was leaked in the press. The letter, first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, warned \u201cif we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset - our sailors\u201d. Thomas Modly, the Navy secretary, announced Crozier\u2019s dismissal due to loss of confidence and not using his chain of command. While Modly accused Crozier of creating a \u201cpanic\u201d, online videos showed what the Navy Times dubbed a \u201chero\u2019s farewell\u201d. Stephen Kohn, a Washington DC-based attorney who represents whistleblowers (but is not representing Crozier) said military law permitted Crozier to inform officials of \u201clife-threatening conditions\u201d as well as \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d by the US Navy. \u201cConsequently, Captain Crozier\u2019s memorandum to the Navy was a protected disclosure under law,\u201d Kohn said. CNN has reported that the Navy was concerned that Crozier had used an \u201cunsecure system\u201d to email his memo, increasing chances that it could be leaked. Kohn said the justification appeared to raise the spectre of illegal retaliation. \u201cUnder military law, whistleblower disclosures made by Captain Crozier would only lose their protection if they were \u2018unlawful.\u2019 The Navy has not alleged that any of Captain Crozier\u2019s communications violated the law,\u201d Kohn said. Washington may not see its peak of coronavirus hospitalizations until July, mayor Muriel Bowser announced in a briefing on the capital city\u2019s response to the pandemic. Bowser said Washington would need more than 2,700 new ICU beds by early July to address the surge in hospitalizations. The city has less than 100 ICU beds available now. Officials estimate that Washington will see 93,000 cases of coronavirus over the course of the pandemic and up to 1,000 fatalities. More than 700 cases have already been confirmed in the city, and 15 residents have died. Bowser also unsurprisingly confirmed that the city\u2019s schools will not reopen on April 27, as previously hoped, but a final decision on that matter will be issued later. The Guardian\u2019s Andrew Roth reports from Moscow: Hundreds of US citizens have been stranded in Moscow after an evacuation flight to New York was grounded at the last moment due to a Russian ban on all international flights. The Aeroflot flight was meant to carry US citizens seeking to leave Russia, and then repatriate hundreds of Russians stranded in the United States. Russia has closed its international borders for most travellers, and this afternoon announced that it would impose a ban on all international flights in and out of Russia as of Saturday morning. The flight cancellation came after passengers had already boarded the flight. Some had been trying to leave Russia for weeks. Others had been living in Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport for days, waiting for a chance to leave the country. Nicholas Mackay, a ballet photographer who lives in Russia, said that he has been trying to travel to the United States for several weeks to reach his father, who is sick with cancer. \u201cWe were already on the flight, and then a flight attendant came on over the intercom and told us that we are not flying out, the flight is cancelled and all flights are cancelled by the Russian government,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThere\u2019s no information. We\u2019re not even able to get any money back from our flight. We\u2019re only able to change for a different day. A different day is no day, because no one knows when international travel will be OK in this whole situation.\u201d A US embassy spokesperson said: \u201cThe US Embassy is aware of the inexplicable cancellation of today\u2019s Aeroflot flight to New York. The flight was full of US citizens anxious to get home. We are awaiting an explanation from the Russian Federation. We continue to work to find ways to help US citizens return home.\u201d During his daily briefing, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the temporary hopsital at the Javits Center would be converted into a coronavirus facility because there are so few non-coronavirus cases right now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have non-Covid people to any great extent in the hospitals,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cHospitals have now turned into effectively ICU hospitals for Covid patients.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s comments come as reports indicate the Navy hospital ship Comfort, which is in New York to treat non-coronavirus patients, has only received 20 patients so far. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s emergency rooms are overrun with coronavirus patients, and medical professionals are working long hours to confront the surge in cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just wrapped up his daily briefing on the state\u2019s coronavirus response. Here\u2019s what he covered: Cuomo will sign an executive order to allow the state to take ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases and give them to hospitals in need. Cuomo pushed back against a reporter who said the state would \u201cseize\u201d the medical equipment, but that seems like an accurate description considering the National Guard will be used for the operation. New York has recorded 2,935 deaths linked to coronavirus, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, marking the largest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis struck the state. New York has also confirmed 102,863 cases of the virus. Officials offered a mixed message on whether everyone should wear face coverings to limit the spread of the virus. State health commissioner Howard Zucker noted there was no data to confirm face coverings help prevent transmissions, but Cuomo said it \u201ccouldn\u2019t hurt\u201d to wear them. Cuomo once again expressed bafflement and anger that the state has to rely on China for the production of medical equipment. \u201cIt is unbelievable to me that in New York state, in the United States of America, that we can\u2019t make these materials,\u201d Cuomo said. The temporary hospital at the Javits Center will begin receiving coronavirus patients, even though officials originally said the facility would treat non-coronavirus patients. Cuomo said there simply aren\u2019t enough non-coronavirus cases right now to make that plan worthwhile. New York governor Andrew Cuomo closed his press conference on a message of hope, saying the state will \u201cfind the light\u201d at the end of this crisis. \u201cThis is hard personally,\u201d Cuomo said of the state\u2019s rising coronavirus death toll. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in this all day and then it\u2019s hard staying up all night watching the numbers go up \u2026 and knowing that you\u2019re in charge of the ship.\u201d But the governor emphasized the state would make it through the pandemic. \u201cOnce you go through darkness, you will find the light,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe will find the light.\u201d Moments ago, New York officials painted a mixed picture on whether all residents should wear face coverings to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s no data to support the effectiveness of face masks,\u201d said Dr Howard Zucker, the New York state health commissioner. But governor Andrew Cuomo then suggested it might be worth wearing face coverings considering the lack of clear evidence on the matter. \u201cThe masks couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo dismissed concerns that the state may be sued over his executive order to take ventilators from hospitals with fewer coronavirus cases. \u201cIf they want to sue me for borrrowing their excess ventilators to save lives, then let them sue me,\u201d Cuomo said of the plan. Cuomo noted the state would return the ventilators to their owners or reimburse them for the cost of the equipment. New York governor Andrew Cuomo pushed back against the word \u201cseize\u201d to describe the redistribution of ventilators from less-stressed hospitals to the hospitals with the most coronavirus cases. \u201cIt\u2019s sharing of resources,\u201d Cuomo said of the executive order he plans to sign. But that characterization seems dubious, considering Cuomo said the National Guard would be used to take the ventilators. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said 20,000 medical professionals from other parts of the country have volunteered to help the state as it confronts this crisis. Cuomo emphasized the state would send similar aid to \u201cany community in this nation that needs it\u201d once New York passes its peak number of coronavirus cases. New York mayor Bill de Blasio suggested earlier today that the country needs a national enlistment program for medical professionals to deploy staff to the most stressed regions as the crisis develops. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said ventilators would be seized from less-stressed hospitals to give them to areas where they are \u201curgently required to save lives.\u201d The use of military members to seize medical equipment sends a clear message that New York is entering a new phase of the coronavirus crisis, coming as the state recorded its highest single-day death toll yet. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order to seize medical equipment from hospitals that are not as overwhelmed with coronavirus patients right now. Cuomo said the National Guard would be used to take ventilators and personal protective equipment to help hospitals that are particularly hard hit right now, presumably those in New York City and Long Island. Cuomo said the equipment would be returned or reimbursed, but the move is likely to spark outcry from hospitals in upstate New York, which has seen fewer coronavirus cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the temporary hospital constructed at the Javits Center in Manhattan would now receive coronavirus patients. The orignal plan was for the convention center to receive non-coronavirus patients to help free up space in the city\u2019s hospitals, but Cuomo said there were simply not enough non-coronavirus patients right now to make that plan worthwhile. Cuomo also warned that the city is running dangerously low on ventilators. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough,\u201d the governor said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Cuomo said yesterady that the state was expected to run out of ventilators in less than a week. New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed bafflement and anger that the US cannot produce its own medical materials as hospitals run dangerously low on personal protective equipment. \u201cIt is unbelievable to me that in New York state, in the United States of America, that we can\u2019t make these materials,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor implored companies yesterday to shift production toward medical equipment, promising to pay \u201ca premium\u201d for the materials. New York has recorded 2,935 deaths linked to coronavirus, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. Cuomo said the increase in the death toll represented the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck the state. New York has also confirmed 102,863 cases of coronavirus, far more than any other US state. Congressman Adam Schiff said in a statement that the proposed commission to probe the coronavirus response would not be aimed at \u201cscoring political points.\u201d \u201cThis is not an exercise in casting blame or scoring political points, but something that the American people should rightly expect from their government as an exercise in accountability,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIn designing such a commission, I believe that the 9/11 Commission provides an established and proven model, one which Congress should adapt to the purposes of the Coronavirus.\u201d But Trump has already made clear he is steadfastly opposed to the idea, dismissing any potential review commission as another \u201cwitch-hunt.\u201d House intelligence committe chairman Adam Schiff has drafted a bill to form a commission, in the style of the 9/11 commission, to investigate the US response to coronavirus. Schiff said the commission would be comprised of 10 members from both parties and would not be formed until February 2021, \u201chopefully after the pandemic has been overcome and after the presidential election.\u201d Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the House homeland security committee, has already drafted a similar bill, but it\u2019s unclear whether House speaker Nancy Pelosi supports the proposal. Pelosi announced yesterday that a House select committee would be formed to ensure appropriate use of government funds in the $2tn stimulus package, but she did not commit to supporting a review commission when asked about the matter by reporters. Trump dismissed the idea out of hand during the daily White House press conference yesterday, arguing the proposal was a partisan attack strategy. \u201cThis is not the time for politics,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou see what happens. It\u2019s witch-hunt after witch-hunt after witch-hunt and, in the end, the people doing the witch-hunt have been losing, and they\u2019ve been losing by a lot. It\u2019s not any time for witch-hunts.\u201d A Navy captain who was relieved from his post after raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship was celebrated by his crew members as he departed. Captain Brett Crozier was dismissed yesterday for showing \u201cpoor judgment\u201d after a letter he wrote warning about a coronavirus outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt was leaked to the press. In the letter, Crozier wrote, \u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2014 our Sailors.\u201d Most of the ship\u2019s crew members were allowed to disembark and quarantine after the letter became public, but the incident cost Crozier his job. Last night, hundreds of sailors gathered to wish Crozier farewell, and videos posted to social media showed crew members chanting the captain\u2019s name as he departed. A Navy ship hospital docked in New York to help the city amid the coronavirus crisis has only received 20 patients. The Comfort\u2019s arrival into New York Harbor was celebrated on Monday, but a laborious process to receive patients has hobbled the hospital ship\u2019s usefulness as many of the city\u2019s emergency rooms are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. The New York Times reports: On Thursday, though, the huge white vessel, which officials had promised would bring succor to a city on the brink, sat mostly empty, infuriating executives at local hospitals. The ship\u2019s 1,000 beds are largely unused, its 1,200-member crew mostly idle. Only 20 patients had been transferred to the ship, officials said, even as New York hospitals struggled to find space for the thousands infected with the coronavirus. Another Navy hospital ship, the U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in Los Angeles, has had a total of 15 patients, officials said. \u2018If I\u2019m blunt about it, it\u2019s a joke,\u2019 said Michael Dowling, the head of Northwell Health, New York\u2019s largest hospital system. \u2018Everyone can say, \u2018Thank you for putting up these wonderful places and opening up these cavernous halls.\u2019 But we\u2019re in a crisis here, we\u2019re in a battlefield.\u2019 ... Ambulances cannot take patients directly to the Comfort; they must first deliver patients to a city hospital for a lengthy evaluation \u2014 including a test for the virus \u2014 and then pick them up again for transport to the ship. The Comfort was originally supposed to treat non-coronavirus patients, but that theory has been difficult to put into practice, and hospital executives complain the hospital ship serves little purpose if it cannot help address the surge of coronavirus cases. The company 3M has responded to Trump\u2019s criticism of its production of N95 masks after the president implied 3M was negatively impacting the US coronavirus response. Trump issued an order under the Defense Production Act yesterday to have 3M step up its production of face masks and then sent this mysterious tweet: The CEO of 3M fiercely pushed back against Trump\u2019s criticism this morning, saying the company started doubling its production of masks in late January in response to coronavirus. \u201cThe narrative that we aren\u2019t doing everything we can as a company is just not true,\u201d CEO Mike Roman said. New York mayor Bill de Blasio called for the creation of an enlistment program for medical professionals to help combat the pandemic. \u201cNext week in New York City is going to be very tough \u2014 next week in New York City and Detroit and New Orleans and a lot of other places,\u201d de Blasio told MSNBC this morning. \u201cAnd unless the military is fully mobilized and we create something we\u2019ve never had before, which is some kind of national enlistment of medical personnel moved to the most urgent needs in the country constantly, if we don\u2019t have that we\u2019re going to see hospitals simply unable to handle so many people who could be saved.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo has similarly asked for medical professionals from other parts of the country to come to New York as the state sees the highest number of coronavirus cases, promising to \u201creturn the favor\u201d once the virus hits their communities. Dr Anthony Fauci said this morning that Americans can use face coverings to lower their risk of getting coronavirus. The federal government is expected to soon revise its recommendations on face coverings, after health officials initially saying masks were not necessary for the general public. But Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the coverings could be helpful for instances when people are not able to stay six feet apart, like at pharmacies. \u201cBecause of that and because of some recent information that the virus can actually be spread even when people just speak, as opposed to coughing and sneezing, the better part of valor is that when you\u2019re out, and you can\u2019t maintain that six-foot distance, to wear some sort of facial covering,\u201d Fauci told Fox News. But the senior official emphasized Americans should still practice social distancing, adding that medical professionals would still have the highest priority in getting face masks. The US jobs report released this morning shows that the unemployment rate has risen to 4.4% after the country lost 701,000 jobs last month. The latest figure marks a 0.9% increase from last month\u2019s rate of 3.5%, which was a 50-year low in the US unemplyment rate. The jobs report also ends a decade of job growth since the financial crisis, as the country braces for another recession because of the coronavirus pandemic. Adding to the disappointing news, the unemployment rate is expected to only go up. Nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past two weeks, and the Congressional Budget Office predicted yesterday that unemployment in the second quarter of this year would pass 10%. Read more on the numbers from the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe: Good morning, live blog readers! About 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders as states try to mitigate the spread of coronavirus by enforcing social distancing guidelines. However, a handful of governors are still resisting issuing statwide orders, and Donald Trump has been hesitant to issue a federal order to enforce the guidelines. Last night on CNN, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he was baffled as to why every state does not have an order in effect. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s not happening,\u201d Fauci told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, saying the governors who have not issued statewide orders \u201creally should\u201d reconsider. But the official made clear he was not explicitly calling for a federal order. \u201cYou know, the tension between federally mandated versus states\u2019 rights to do what they want is something I don\u2019t want to get into,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at what\u2019s going on in this country, I just don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d Fauci\u2019s comments came as the US reported 1,169 coronavirus deaths, the highest one-day death toll of any country so far, although that record is bound to be quickly broken.",
