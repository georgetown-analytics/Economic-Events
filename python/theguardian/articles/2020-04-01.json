      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Thursday\u2019s blog: The White House predicts that up to 240,000 Americans will die of coronavirus, even if the US abides by distancing measures, officials announced during the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The president repeatedly asserted that millions would have died if he hadn\u2019t stepped in. The coronavirus task force briefing that lasted for two hours. Throughout, the president made false and misleading claims. Through most of the lengthy debate, Trump struck an unusually quiet and somber tone, warning of the \u201ctough two weeks\u201d to come. But he also attacked governors, news reporters and critics as he defended his record. New York governor Andrew Cuomo lamented the bidding wars over ventilators. Cuomo said having numerous states and FEMA simultaneously trying to obtain the crucial breathing machines was \u201clike being on eBay.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, was diagnosed with coronavirus. The governor said his brother \u201cwill be fine\u201d considering his age and overall health, but he added that the diagnosis underscored the need to maintain social distancing practices. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Trump\u2019s impeachment distracted lawmakers from responding to coronavirus, a claim that was quickly criticized by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who called for the virus to be declared a public health emergency in late January. Trump himself said that he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently if the impeachment trial didn\u2019t take place. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden emphasized the need for more testing to combat the virus. Both of the prominent Democrats also demanded that Trump immediately use the full powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of medical equipment. Read the full story on Trump\u2019s latest press conference here: Opinion: Ice agents are still performing raids \u2013 and using precious N95 masks to do so Public health experts and providers Miriam Maga\u00f1a Lopez and Seth M Holmes write: On the first day of California\u2019s \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d lockdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents raided immigrant communities in Los Angeles. Different from other raids, they carried N95 medical masks to protect themselves from Covid-19. Also different from previous raids, the Ice agents broke state regulations that ordered everyone to stay home except to do \u201cessential\u201d activities necessary to survive (eg buying food or medicine). The protective masks Ice agents carried to raid communities in LA are the same personal protective equipment that made headlines in the last week due to extreme shortages endangering the lives of healthcare workers. These frontline health professionals care for patients without this basic protective equipment, forced to risk not only their own health but also the capacity of our health system in this critical pandemic. In fact, the surgeon general issued a statement requesting that all N95 masks be saved for doctors, nurses and other frontline health workers. In a time with severe shortages and orders to \u201cshelter in place\u201d, the federal government chose to prioritize masks for Ice agents instead of necessary health personnel and, ultimately, chose raids over the health of our country. During today\u2019s briefing, Trump said that all governors had to do if they needed ventilators, was ask. He also suggested that the US was \u201cholding on\u201d to a stockpile of 10,000 ventilators, that the government would slowly and strategically dole out. He also said the government has asked companies to send equipment directly to states. At the same time, he derided and dismissed New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s complaint that states have to bid for ventilators, competing with other states and Fema to secure life-saving equipment. \u201cThe federal government, Fema, should have been the purchasing agent: buy everything and then allocate by need to the states,\u201d Cuomo said today. \u201cWhy would you create a situation where the 50 states are competing with each other and then the federal government and Fema comes in and competes with the rest of it?\u201d Without addressing why the federal government isn\u2019t stepping in to secure the equipment at a fair price, Trump said that Cuomo,\u201d shouldn\u2019t be complaining because we gave him a lot of ventilators.\u201d \u201cNo matter what you give, it\u2019s never enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly dark topic,\u201d Trump said, before leaving the podium. \u201cAn incredibly horrible topic. And it\u2019s incredibly interesting. That\u2019s why everybody is, They\u2019re going crazy, they can\u2019t get enough of it.\u201d Fact check: \u201cNobody knew\u201d \u201cNobody knew how contagious this was,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any doctor new it at the time. People have not seen anything like this.\u201d In fact, as the disease spread through China, public health experts were warning for weeks that the coronavirus threat could grow into a pandemic. Moreover, epidemiologists have been predicting this sort of pandemic for years. The US intelligence community, in its January 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment, wrote: \u201cWe assess that the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.\u201d Once again, Trump misrepresented his administration\u2019s travel restrictions, saying that he \u201cstopped\u201d travel from Italy before issuing broader restrictions on travel from Europe. Through the administration issued travel advisories for parts of Italy, he never banned travel from Italy. The briefing has now reached the two hour mark. \u201cThis is really easy to be negative about. But I want to give people hope, too,\u201d Trump said, abandoning the quiet, somber tone he used earlier in the briefing. \u201cI\u2019m not about bad news,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to give people hope. I want to give people the feeling that we all have a chance.\u201d As he has during previous briefings, the president then became combative, attacking reporters and dismissing what he called \u201cstupid question\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve acted any differently. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve acted any faster,\u201d Trump said when asked if the impeachment distracted him from the coronavirus crisis. Senate leader Mitch McConnell, has blamed the impeachment trial for distracting from the crisis. \u201cI think it diverted the attention of the government because everything every day was all about impeachment,\u201d McConnell said in an interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d Fact check: Even more on ventilators Earlier, Dr. Birx said that the US is better positioned than the UK on ventilators. \u201cThey have 8000 ventilators in the UK. If you translate that to the US that would be equivalent to us having 40000 ventilators. We have five times that,\u201d she said. Indeed, the UK Cabinet Office said that there are 8,000 ventilators currently in the NHS with a further 8,000 already on order from overseas. The US has nearly five times the population of the UK, so Birx\u2019s idea to multiply 8,000 ventilators by 5 to gauge a comparison makes sense. But it\u2019s unclear how many ventilators the US has. Estimates published in the New England Journal of Medicine guess 60,000 to 160,000 \u2014 that\u2019s fewer than Birx\u2019s boast. \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million,\u201d wrote public health experts in the NEJM. Fact check: Travel bans As evidence that he acted early and effectively, the president touted his piecemeal travel bans and restrictions \u2014 which epidemiologists said could have stopped the spread of disease if implemented much earlier than they were \u2014 but ultimately did little more than cause chaos and confusion at airports. \u201cWe stopped all of Europe,\u201d Trump boasted. But the restrictions didn\u2019t apply to all of Europe and included restrictions for several types of travelers. Dr. Fauci said \u201cI believe we acted early,\u201d in response to a question about whether the US could have done more, earlier. But he conceded that earlier action could have helped. Dr. Birx, as well, evaded the question, asserting that it remains to be seen whether the disease was spreading through the US in February or earlier. Fact check: Hydroxychloroquine cure Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure, asserting that it won\u2019t kill people because it has already been used to treat other conditions. But the drug can have serious side effects even when it is used as recommended, to treat malaria, as well as lupus and arthritis. Moreover, public health experts including his own top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Fauci, have previously warned that there was only \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d that the drugs could be helpful. My colleague Oliver Milman reported that a French study of 40 coronavirus patients found that half experienced clearing of their airways after being given hydroxychloroquine. Experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has reportedly caused stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine. Fact check: Ventilators, again The government has almost 10,000 ventilators remaining in the stockpile, Trump said, but \u201cwe are holding it back for flexibility,\u201d he said, so they can be distributed strategically. The strategic reserve of medical supplies is like an oil reserve, Trump added, except more valuable. Asked about reports that governors are caught in bidding wars for the life-saving machines, Trump said: \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d All they need to do is ask, he said. But the president has repeatedly dismissed governors\u2019 requests for medical equipment. In an interview with Fox News last week, he said \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying, \u2018Can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u2019\u201d Even today, he added that though governors could ask, in some cases, \u201cthey want to have more than they think they need\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not the flu,\u201d Trump said of the coronavirus. \u201cIt is vicious.\u201d The president has repeatedly compared the coronavirus pandemic to the seasonal flu. Fact check: Late start Though Trump is seeking to blame states for a delayed response to the coronavirus crisis, the president consistently downplayed the concerns of public health officials who raised early alarms. In late January, at the Davos conference, Trump said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d In February, after the WHO announced more than 25,000 cases worldwide, Trump said that it \u201clooks like, by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.\u201d And earlier this month, Trump tweeted this: Now, Trump is agreeing that at least 100,000 Americans could die. Trump, Birx and Fauci have piled on New York. \u201cAll of our major cities modeled like New Yor is what gets us into trouble,\u201d Birx said. \u201cCalifornia and Washington state reacted very early to this.\u201d \u201cFor whatever reason, New York got off to a very late start,\u201d Trump added. \u201cAnd you see what happens when you get off to a late start.\u201d The president is arguing that he is saving the country from a much worse fate than 100,000 to 240,000 deaths. \u201c100,000 is, is \u2014 according to modeling, a very low number.\u201d \u201cYou would have had people dying all over the place,\u201d Trump said, painting a picture of what would have happened if the country had done nothing. \u201cYou would have seen people dying in airplanes, you would have seen people dying in hotel lobbies.\u201d \u201cHow many people have even seen anybody die?\u201d he said. \u201cYou would have seen death all over.\u201d Of course, Trump was among those who downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus threat early on. Just last week, he pushed to scale back distancing measures by Easter. Fact check: Testing \u201cWe are doing more than anybody else in the world, by far\u201d on testing, Trump said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re very accurate tests.\u201d In fact, the US has lagged behind many other countries in testing. As of Monday afternoon, the US, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 944,854, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a group led by Alexis Madrigal, a staff writer for The Atlantic magazine, with more than 100 volunteers that compiles coronavirus testing data from states. This equates to 287 tests per 100,000 people in the US (with huge variations depending on the county, city and state) compared to 709 per 100,000 in South Korea and 600 per 100,000 in Italy. About 65,000 coronavirus tests a day are currently being done on Americans \u2014 a massive rise from 10 days ago. But there\u2019s huge variation from state to state, and public health experts reckon 150,000 tests are needed every day so that infected patients can be identified quickly, traced and quarantined To match South Korea\u2019s testing rate, the U.S. would have needed to conduct another 2 million tests. Moreover, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed \u2013 some did not even work. Part of the problem came from the CDC insisting it would manufacture the tests itself. Moreover, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed \u2013 some did not even work. Part of the problem came from the CDC insisting it would manufacture the tests itself. Other countries \u2013 after their first coronavirus case \u2013 swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests. South Korea, which recorded its first case on the same day as the US, did so within a week The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on February 29, almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed. \u201cThe federal agency shunned the World Health Organization test guidelines used by other countries and set out to create a more complicated test of its own that could identify a range of similar viruses,\u201d ProPublica reported. The graphic outlining the predicted number of deaths, with and without mitigation, isn\u2019t presented in a particularly sensitive manner. As a New York Times reporter in the room noted, the slide listed as \u201cgoals\u201d up to 240,000 deaths. That terrifying number is lower than 2.2m deaths that could occur if no distancing or mitigating measures are taken, according to the model presented by Birx. The White House has predicted 100,000 to 240,000 deaths in the US from coronavirus pandemic, even with mitigation measures. This isn\u2019t the first time that the task force scientists have presented these grim projections. But Birx said the model doesn\u2019t assume every American does everything they\u2019re supposed to do, \u201cso it can be lower than that,\u201d she said. \u201cOur hope is to get that down as much as we can,\u201d Fauci added. The numbers are what \u201cwe need to anticipate, but that doesn\u2019t mean that that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to accept.\u201d Fact check: More on ventilators Trump warned that the \u201csurge is coming and it\u2019s coming pretty strong\u201d and so the federal government is \u201cholding back\u201d 10,000 ventilators. The actual number of ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile is around 16,600, according to reports last week. This total is barely enough for what New York requires, let alone the rest of the US. A greater problem, perhaps, is the lack of a strong ramp-up in ventilator production for patients in the US. An investigation by ProPublica found that the federal government signed a $13.8 million contract with a Pennsylvania manufacturer to create a low-cost, portable, easy-to-use ventilator to stockpile for an emergency such as the spread of Covid-19, only for the company to then sell a more expensive version around the world rather than supplement the stockpile. \u201cWe gotta brace ourselves,\u201d said Dr. Anthony Fauci. The number of cases will continue to go up for in the coming week, he said. \u201cWe cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work.\u201d Early mitigation slowing the spread of disease in California and Washington state is \u201cgives us great hope,\u201d said Dr. Deborah Birx. According to modeling that she presented, which assumes that Americans will abide by strict distancing measures, showed the virus receding about July 1. \u201cThere is no magic bullet. No magic vaccine or therapy. Its just behavior\u201d she said. \u201cWe are going to go through a very tough two weeks,\u201d Trump said, striking a more somber tone than he has at previous briefings. \u201cThis is going to be a very, very painful two weeks.\u201d There will be\u201clight at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he added. We are going to see things get better \u201call of a sudden\u201d like a \u201cburst of light.\u201d Fact check: US unemployment pre-pandemic Trump praised the sacrifice made by the American public and businesses before stating that the US has the \u201cgreatest economy in the history of our country.\u201d He added that \u201cwe had the best unemployment numbers and best employment number we\u2019ve had, by far.\u201d While the US unemployment rate has dropped to low levels during Trump\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s not at an all-time record. In April last year, the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% - the lowest since 1969. This rate was at or below 4% for the preceding year. Fact check: 10,000 ventilators Trump once again touted US stockpile of 10,000 ventilators, which he said the government is \u201cholding back\u201d strategically. In fact, there are 16,600, according to the Center for Public Integrity. But even that won\u2019t be enough to meet the demand. But experts say that the government\u2019s secretive stockpile of medicines, vaccines, protective clothing and equipment, stashed in a dozen warehouses across the country, isn\u2019t enough to meet the demand for medical equipment needed to treat coronavirus patients. State governors, including Andrew Cuomo of New York, have asked for tens of thousands of ventilators. In an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, public health experts wrote: \u201cThe national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d Because Europe \u201ctook a much different route than we did, a much different route,\u201d in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cthey\u2019re having tremendous problems,\u201d Trump said. As he did during yesterday\u2019s briefing, the president is attempting to paint the US\u2019 delayed and chaotic response to the pandemic as superior to Europe. Yesterday, Trump implied that the US would soon have such a surplus of scarce and necessary medical equipment that he\u2019d be able to send the excess to Italy, France and Spain. \u201cThere\u2019s a great pride going on right now,\u201d the president said. He signaled that the Treasury and Small Business Administration have announced further details on the paycheck protection program, which provides $350bn for small businesses to continue making payroll for two months. Donald Trump has appeared in the briefing room alongside the task force. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh \u2014 blogging from the West Coast. We\u2019re awaiting the daily coronavirus briefing from Trump and other members of the White House task force responding to the pandemic. Florida governor Ron DeSantis says the task force hasn\u2019t advised him to issue a statewide closure. \u201cThe task force is not recommending this,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIf they do, that\u2019s something that would carry a lot of weight with me.\u201d But according to the Miami Herald, one of the epidemiologists behind a coronavirus model cited by the White House said he told Florida\u2019s top health official Monday night that a blanket stay-at-home order was urgently necessary. Though DeSantis, a Republican, has ordered people visiting from New York to self-quarantine and has issued \u201csafer-at-home\u201d mandates for South Florida, he has so far resisted more sweeping actions. The state has reported more 5,000 positive coronavirus cases, with 523 new positive cases on Sunday. The last day of the month in an election year is usually a major fundraising deadline, with campaigns rushing to run up their numbers before the Federal Elections Commission reporting deadline at midnight. But how do you fundraise in the middle of a pandemic, when the FEC deadline coincides with the first day that millions of newly unemployed Americans will have to pay rent? The US presidential campaigns have all suspended in-person events, which makes digital fundraising an imperative. Former vice president Joe Biden has sent out a number of fundraising requests via SMS, and is also running Facebook ads asking for donations. His ads do not directly name the coronavirus pandemic, but they do make reference to \u201cthese uncertain times\u201d. The imagery is generally positive and reassuring. Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is running hundreds of Facebook ads referencing the FEC deadline at midnight, some of which use the language and imagery of a billing \u201cnotice\u201d. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign is not running any Facebook ads. The campaign did send an SMS message to supporters on Monday asking for donations \u2013 but the money was earmarked for six groups providing support to different groups during the coronavirus pandemic, including mutual aid funds for Amazon workers, gig workers, artists, and restaurant workers. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo lamented the bidding wars over ventilators. Cuomo said having numerous states and FEMA simultaneously trying to obtain the crucial breathing machines was \u201clike being on eBay.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, was diagnosed with coronavirus. The governor said his brother \u201cwill be fine\u201d considering his age and overall health, but he added that the diagnosis underscored the need to maintain social distancing practices. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Trump\u2019s impeachment distracted lawmakers from responding to coronavirus, a claim that was quickly criticized by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who called for the virus to be declared a public health emergency in late January. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden emphasized the need for more testing to combat the virus. Both of the prominent Democrats also demanded that Trump immediately use the full powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up the production of medical equipment. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump\u2019s daily press conference on the US response to coronavirus was even more of a spectacle yesterday than usual. The president was accused of using the briefing to promote specific companies, including MyPillow, whose chief executive Mike Lindell has become a regular at Trump rallies. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith reported yesterday: Trump praised companies for doing their \u2018patriotic duty\u2019 by producing or donating medical equipment to meet America\u2019s most urgent needs. \u2018What they\u2019re doing is incredible,\u2019 he said. \u2018These are great companies.\u2019 He went on to invite Lindell, Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell, Debra Waller of Jockey International, David Taylor of Procter &amp; Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies to make short speeches. He introduced Lindell as a \u2018friend\u2019 and riffed: \u2018Boy, do you sell those pillows, it\u2019s unbelievable what you do.\u2019 Trump\u2019s daily press conference on the coronavirus response will be slightly delayed. The event, which was scheduled to start in about 25 minutes at 5 pm ET, will now start at 5:15. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer criticized majority leader Mitch McConnell for suggesting impeachment distracted lawmakers from the coronavirus response. The New York Democrat noted he said in late January, as Trump\u2019s impeachment trial was going on, that coronavirus should be declared a public health emergency. McConnell said in a radio interview earlier today that the impeachment trial \u201cdiverted the attention of the government\u201d from responding earlier to the outbreak of the virus. But even after the impeachment trial ended in early February, Trump spent weeks downplaying the virus, incorrectly predicting that it would miraculously \u201cdisappear\u201d before causing major effects in the US. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports: A separate program California launched this week, which calls to duty recently retired health care professionals and those on the verge of completing degrees, is off to a roaring start. About 25,000 people met the call and filled out applications, governor Gavin Newsom said. Also new: Health officials in seven Bay Area jurisdictions have extended a previous stay-at-home order, set to expire 7 April, to 3 May. The new order says that most construction is to cease \u2014 both on residential and commercial projects. Previous guidance had a grey area as it related to construction in that residential projects were allowed to continue work but not commercial projects. Some updates the governor provided, by the numbers: 10,000: The number of ventilators needed in California. 4,252: The number of ventilators the state has on hand. 1.6 million: The number of people who have filed for unemployment in California since March 13. 100 million-plus: The number of masks needed for healthcare workers and others. 6,932: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in California, a 17% increase from yesterday. 150: The number of deaths from coronavirus across the state. 1,617: The number of people hospitalized, a 13% increase from yesterday. 657: Patients admitted to ICUs, a 10% increase from yesterday. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports: California has created a hotline for seniors who are isolated in their homes and may need help with daily needs as well as a live person to speak with. California governor Gavin Newsom today announced that the state is partnering with groups like AARP, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association and American Lung Association to set up the hotline. California will also join 2-1-1, which connects people to local resources. The hotline number is: (833) 544-2374. \u201cWe\u2019re now reconstituting all of those programs and building capacity and partnership to significantly increase our connectivity to our seniors to check not just for wellness checks related to food and medicine but the deep anxiety people are feeling being isolated at home and the loneliness people are feeling at home not connected to the outside world, anxious about their life and their loved ones\u2019 lives,\u201d Newsom said. Roughly 5.3 million Californians are over 65 and an estimated one million live alone. \u201cCheck in on your neighbors, make those phone calls,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019re all bound together by a big web of mutuality.\u201d Trump has appeared reluctant to use the powers of the Defense Production Act even though his administration has invoked it many times before. The New York Times reports: A Korean War-era law called the Defense Production Act has been invoked hundreds of thousands of times by President Trump and his administration to ensure the procurement of vital equipment, according to reports submitted to Congress and interviews with former government officials. Yet as governors and members of Congress plead with the president to use the law to force the production of ventilators and other medical equipment to combat the coronavirus pandemic, he has for weeks treated it like a \u2018break the glass\u2019 last resort, to be invoked only when all else fails. Trump said Friday he would use the law to press General Motors to produce ventilators, although the company has said it is already moving quickly to make the breathing machines. But a number of Democrats, including Joe Biden and House speaker Nancy Pelosi, have demanded that Trump use the full force of the law to speed up the production of medical equipment. Joe Biden also dodged a question about whether Trump\u2019s delayed response to coronavirus has cost American lives, as House speaker Nancy Pelosi has claimed. \u201cPresident Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus,\u201d Biden said in response to a question from CNN host Brooke Baldwin. \u201cBut he is responsible for not using all of the power at his disposal to deal with this virus.\u201d Biden has specifically called on Trump to use the powers of the Defense Production Act to speed up production of medical equipment. Joe Biden emphasized the need for more tests to combat coronavirus, echoing House speaker Nancy Pelosi and a number of governors from both parties. Biden told CNN it was important to identify and track coronavirus patients to mitigate the spread of the virus, but states have complained about inadequate testing. The Democratic frontrunner also complained that many of the claims Trump has made about the pandemic are \u201csimply not accurate.\u201d Biden pointed to the president\u2019s claim yesterday that he had not peviously heard about the need for more tests. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s been,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president added Trump has been \u201cvery slow to act\u201d against the virus, echoing other Democrats\u2019 criticism of the president. California has nearly 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, governor Gavin Newsom said in a virtual press briefing. Newsom also noted that 25,000 retired and student medical professionals have volunteered to help with the coronavirus crisis. Speaker Nancy Pelosi presided over a pro forma session in the House, which is expected to be out of session until April 20. The resignation of congressman Mark Meadows, who is leaving the House to become Trump\u2019s chief of staff, was read on the floor. Meadows\u2019 resignation is effective at 5 pm today. Pelosi said, \u201cThe whole number of the House is 429.\u201d New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has closed 10 playgrounds across the city after residents failed to adhere to social distancing guidelines there. The mayor also issued a plea to people who may have ventilators in their office, such as plastic surgeons or veterinarians, to donate them to the coronavirus response effort. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a vent in your office, in your operating room, we need it now,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be sitting there doing nothing.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo has said the state needs thousands more ventilators to prepare for the expected surge in coronavirus cases. The Guardian\u2019s Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield report: Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Martinique and Barbados have refused to accept the medical evacuation of two critically ill passengers from a stranded coronavirus-stricken cruise ship, according to the vessel\u2019s owner. Four people have died, nine people have tested positive for covid-19 and dozens of people are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam and the Rotterdam, which are traveling towards Florida to attempt to dock. William Burke, chief maritime officer for the boats\u2019 owners Carnival Corporation, made the disclosure about critically ill passengers while answering questions about plans to enter Port Everglades, which have so far not been approved. Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief told that Guardian that while there may be opponents to the plan to allow the ships to dock, she thinks the plan proposed by Carnival is ultimately a workable approach. \u201cThis is Carnival using their resources to get people home. The county commissioners can\u2019t turn a ship away. They can say what they want. But it\u2019s ultimately up to the county administrator and the Unified Command whether to let the ship come in.\u201d She said most of the calls she is getting from the public are from those who want the county to rescue the passengers. \u201cMost people want us to give humanitarian aid, which is something American is known for. I don\u2019t know how, if there are Americans aboard, we would turn these people away.\u201d Hospitals are threatening to fire staffers who publicly share concerns about working conditions amid the pandemic. Bloomberg News reports: Ming Lin, an emergency room physician in Washington state, said he was told Friday he was out of a job because he\u2019d given an interview to a newspaper about a Facebook post detailing what he believed to be inadequate protective equipment and testing. In Chicago, a nurse was fired after emailing colleagues that she wanted to wear a more protective mask while on duty. In New York, the NYU Langone Health system has warned employees they could be terminated if they talk to the media without authorization. \u2018Hospitals are muzzling nurses and other health-care workers in an attempt to preserve their image,\u2019 said Ruth Schubert, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association. \u2018It is outrageous.\u2019 Many hospitals have said they are running dangerously low on personal protective equipment, potentially exposing medical professionals to coronavirus as they treat patients. In Italy, which has seen the most deaths in the pandemic, more than 60 doctors have already died because of the virus. This graph of US coronavirus cases is being widely shared, as the country\u2019s number of cases continues to climb. The graph indicates the US has not yet flattened the curve of coronavirus cases, underscoring the need to continue practicing social distancing in the weeks to come. There is already some early evidence that such measures have helped mitigate the spread of the virus in San Francisco, where officials first told residents to stay home two weeks ago. The captain of a Navy aircraft carrier sent an urgent memo asking for help to contain an outbreak on the ship. Captain Brett Crozier, commander of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, asked that the ship be allowed to dock to let the 5,000 sailors on board quarantine. \u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,\u201d Crozier wrote yesterday to Navy leaders, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIf we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset\u2014our sailors.\u201d Crozier warned the ship, which has already seen at least 70 cases of coronavirus, did not allow for the social distancing recommended by the CDC. \u201cWith the exceptions of a handful of senior officer staterooms, none of the berthing onboard a warship is appropriate for quarantine or isolation,\u201d Crozier wrote. In response, the Navy said it is \u201cmoving quickly to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of the crew of USS Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d A group of New York doctors shared a video urging young people to take social distancing guidelines seriously. The doctors warned that young people can get seriously ill from coronavirus and said those with mild symptoms should immediately self-isolate. The doctors said their hospital is running out of medication, equipment and oxygen, emphasizing it was a dire necessity for Americans to help mitigate the spread of the virus. Watch the video here: The sale of Trump\u2019s Washington hotel has been put on hold as the industry struggles amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Washington Post reports: Trump\u2019s firm, which he still owns, has had to press pause on the proposed sale of its D.C. hotel lease due to the market\u2019s collapse as potential buyers wait for banks and investors to return normal operations. ... Trump\u2019s company, now run by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, announced the planned sale in October and set a January deadline for initial bids. It is unclear how many companies are pursuing the lease, which Trump signed with the federal government before his election, although BET co-founder Sheila Johnson was among the bidders. The Trump Organization has already had to close several properties and lay off hundreds of workers in the face of the pandemic, and the $2 trillion stimulus bill blocks businesses owned by the president from receiving loans or investments from the treasury department. Dr Anthony Fauci said the White House is examining whether to recommend more widespread usage of face masks to mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said medical professionals should still have priority in receiving face masks, considering they are on the front lines against the virus. Officials previously warned Americans against hoarding masks as hospitals said they were running dangerously low on personal protective equipment. But Fauci said there could potentially be some benefit to more widespread usage of the masks if the country can get a sufficient supply of them. \u201cOnce we get in a situation where we have enough masks, I believe there will be some very serious consideration about more broadening this recommendation of using masks,\u201d Fauci told CNN earlier today. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but I think we\u2019re close to coming to some determination.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said he believes the impeachment of Trump distracted lawmakers from responding early to coronavirus. The Kentucky Republican told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt this morning that the virus \u201ccame up while we were tied down on the impeachment trial. And I think it diverted the attention of the government, because everything every day was all about impeachment.\u2033 Trump and Republican lawmakers similarly claimed during the impeachment inquiry that the process was distracting Congress from more important issues. However, it should be noted that Trump was acquitted on February 5, and the president spent the next several weeks downplaying the threat of coronavirus, repeatedly claiming it would \u201cgo away\u201d and predicting the US would be \u201cvery fortunate\u201d in its fight against the virus. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo lamented the current bidding wars over ventilators. Cuomo said having 50 states and FEMA simultaneously trying to obtain more ventilators was \u201clike being on eBay.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, has been diagnosed with coronavirus. The governor said his brother \u201cwill be fine\u201d because of his age and lack of preexisting conditions, but he argued the diagnosis underscored the need to practice social distancing. Nancy Pelosi emphasized the need for more testing to combat the virus. The House speaker also brushed off concerns about her contentious relationship with Trump, saying they communicate through television interviews and other public appearances. (The pair have not spoken in five months.) The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. At his press conference that ended moments ago, New York governor Andrew Cuomo referred to coronavirus as \u201cthe great equalizer,\u201d citing his brother\u2019s recent diagnosis. Cuomo noted his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, was considered an essential worker, so he was going outside more than most New Yorkers and was exposed to the virus. The governor argued Cuomo\u2019s diagnosis underscored the need for New Yorkers to practice social distancing as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. New York governor Andrew Cuomo closed his press conference by criticizing Congress\u2019 response to the coronavirus crisis. Cuomo said the three bills passed by Congress do not provide sufficient funding to New York, which has seen the most coronavirus cases in the country. \u201cGod will determine who is to blame,\u201d Cuomo told a reporter who asked whether he blamed Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, for the funding issue. \u201cYou and I just deal with the reality.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he is dissatisfied with how the state\u2019s unemployment system is working now as many companies lay off employees. \u201cIt is not working as smoothly as I\u2019d like to see it,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s compunding people\u2019s stress.\u201d Cuomo said he was sorry to unemployed residents who are confused on how to obtain benefits. \u201cI apologize for the pain,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt must be infuriating to deal with.\u201d The governor noted the unemployment claims website is \u201cso deluged\u201d because hundreds of thousands of people are trying to access it, so it has repeatedly crashed. New York governor Andrew Cuomo was asked how the state will determine who receives ventilators if there is a shortage. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about that consequence,\u201d the governor replied. But Cuomo has said the state needs thousands more ventilators for the peak of the coronavirus crisis. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the chaos created by a bidding war on ventilators was easily predictable and should have been avoided. \u201cDid you really have to learn that 50 states shouldn\u2019t compete against 50 states, and then FEMA shouldn\u2019t come in late and compete with 50 states?\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you had to go to the Harvard Kennedy school to learn this,\u201d the governor joked. New York governor Andrew Cuomo lamented how many states are bidding against each other to obtain ventilators right now. \u201cYou have 50 states competing to buy the same item. It\u2019s like being on Ebay,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHow inefficient!\u201d Cuomo noted FEMA is now also bidding, further driving up the price for ventilators. \u201cWhat sense does this make?\u201d Cuomo said, raising his voice in frustration. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state has ordered 17,000 ventilators from China at a price of roughly $25,000 each. Cuomo said the state\u2019s financial commitment to the ventilators underscores how badly they are needed to mitigate the coronavirus death toll. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don\u2019t need,\u201d Cuomo said, adding that the state is \u201cbroke.\u201d But Cuomo said the ventilators have been \u201cvery slow in coming out\u201d due to the \u201ctremendous demand\u201d for the equipment right now. The governor said he has a \u201cfirm expectation\u201d on receiving 2500 ventilators in the next two weeks. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state will hit the peak of its coronavirus crisis in seven to 21 days. \u201cThis does me no good,\u201d Cuomo said of the estimate. \u201cThe range is too broad.\u201d Cuomo also noted that there are ranges in the estimates of how many ventilators and hospital beds will be nedded once the number of coronavirus cases hits its highest point. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said there was a lesson to be learned from his brother\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis. Cuomo noted his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, was considered an essential worker. CNN said the host was at its New York offices as recently as last Friday. The governor said he told his brother two weeks ago that their elderly mother could not go over to his home out of concern of spreading the virus. Cuomo reflected on how his mother could have been exposed if those visits had not abruptly ended. \u201cThis virus is that insidious,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo confirmed his brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, has been diagnosed with coronavirus. \u201cHe is going to be fine,\u201d the governor said of his brother. \u201cHe\u2019s young, in good shape, strong, not as strong as he thinks, but he will be fine,\u201d Cuomo joked. The governor said he learned of the diagnosis earlier today. \u201cI spoke to him this morning, and he\u2019s going to be quarantined in his basement at home,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor then reflected on his relationship with his brother. \u201cYou see one dimension, you see a person in his job,\u201d Cuomo told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s a really sweet, beautiful guy, and he\u2019s my best friend.\u201d News of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo\u2019s positive coronavirus test broke as his brother Andrew, the governor of New York, was beginning his daily press conference in Albany. Andrew is discussing Chris now, but here\u2019s what happened when the two brothers spoke to each other in prime time on Monday night. Andrew made headlines by repeatedly rebuffing Chris\u2019s questions about whether he will run for president and also determinedly refused to engage with questions about Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis. But perhaps the most heartwarming section of the interview, mindful of the older Cuomo\u2019s advice that New Yorkers \u201cseek joy\u201d during the coronavirus shutdown, came at the end, when Cuomo the younger discussed his keeping of the secret of their mother\u2019s pasta sauce. Here\u2019s some clips from the transcript. Chris Cuomo: \u2026Last night I was doing what I do for my family which is make my mother\u2019s sauce. She taught me how to make the sauce, which is something that is very coveted. And she said I can only teach he, not she, he who will carry it on best. \u201c\u2026I had a picture of her behind me as I always do when I\u2019m cooking in the kitchen, a picture of my mother to remember our bond and how I care for her that she taught me how to make the sauce. She didn\u2019t teach anybody else. \u201cAnd she called me and said, is Andrew there? I said, \u2018No, mom, I\u2019m all alone here out on the island with my family.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Where is he?\u2019 And I said, \u2018He\u2019s up in Albany in the house with the big gates and the attack dog. And she said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s too bad.\u2019 And I said, \u2018It\u2019s OK, mom. I love him and I\u2019ll make sauce for him, too.\u2019 And she started to cry, and then I said goodbye. That\u2019s what happened. Governor Cuomo: You\u2019ve always been good at manipulation. You\u2019ve always been the meatball of the family. Look, some of us have to work, right? I don\u2019t have the luxury of working one hour a day. God bless you. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d After some more back and forth, Chris Cuomo said: \u201cStay safe. I\u2019ll talk to you soon. I\u2019ll send you some sauce.\u201d Governor Cuomo: Love you, brother. Chris Cuomo: Mom\u2019s secret sauce. Governor Cuomo: Thanks, thanks. I know. Meatball. Chris Cuomo: I heard it. It\u2019s a term of endearment in Italian circles, to be the meatball. Please hang up on him now. Thank you very much. He has a lot of work to do.\u201d Here\u2019s the full video: New York governor Andrew Cuomo said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when the coronavirus crisis may end, and New Yorkers should prepare accordingly. \u201cI can say this, it\u2019s not going to be soon,\u201d Cuomo said of when the crisis may start to dissipate. \u201cSo calibrate yourself and your expectations, so you are not disappointed every morning when you wake up.\u201d Cuomo noted the state may hit its peak number of cases anytime in the next month or so. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state is trying to prepare for when it hits its peak number of coronavirus cases, which will likely come in the next few weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been behind this virus from day one,\u201d Cuomo said, arguing officials and hospitals need to prepare for the likely surge in cases. The governor noted the state is creating a stockpile of medical equipment to prepare for the apex of the crisis. \u201cWe are gathering equipment we don\u2019t need today,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBecause today is not the apex of the battle.\u201d New York govenor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily press conference on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus in Albany. Cuomo said New York has confirmed 172,196 cases of coronavirus and 1,550 deaths, accounting for about half of all deaths in the country. The governor also noted new coronavirus-related hospitalizations surged to its highest level yet in the past 24 hours. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, has been diagnosed with coronavirus. CNN announced the news in a memo, saying Cuomo would continue hosting his show from home. He was last in CNN\u2019s New York offices last Friday. The CNN host has repeatedly conducted remote interviews of his brother, who has become one of the most recognizable faces of the US response to coronavirus, since the crisis started. New York City has seen 932 deaths from coronavirus, marking an increase of 142 since yesterday morning, according to the latest statistics. The city has also seen more than 40,000 cases, the majority of them being people under the age of 50. Coronavirus has claimed more than 3,000 American lives, with yesterday becoming the deadliest day of the pandemic for the US yet. Those figures mean the coronavirus death toll has now surpassed that of the September 11 attacks, which claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans. Nearly half of the coronavirus deaths have occured in New York, although the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has warned other states may soon see a similar rate of coronavirus cases and deaths. Trump called on Congress to pay a $2tn infrastructure bill just days after the president signed a $2tn package meant to aid the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. In his tweet suggesting an infrastructure bill, Trump mentioned \u201cPhase 4,\u201d an apparent reference to Democrats\u2019 calls for another coronavirus bill after three others were signed into law. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday that the fourth coronavirus bill would focus on clean water, rural broadband and infrastructure, among other things. But Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed skepticism this morning about passing another piece of legislation amid the pandemic. And of course, Trump\u2019s talks of \u201cinfrastrucuture week\u201d have become a running joke in Washington, considering his administration has repeatedly tried and failed to pivot to infrastructure as its main legislative focus. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will hold a press briefing in about 30 minutes. The governor will likely be asked about the rising coronavirus death toll in New York City, which has reported more than 900 fatalities connected to the virus. Congressman Max Rose announced he would deploy to the National Guard to help with coronavirus response efforts. Rose, a captain in the Army National Guard, will deploy tomorrow and serve as an operations officer at Staten Island facilities in the coming weeks, his office said in a statement. \u201cOver the past month I have seen acts of incredible bravery and sacrifice by our first responders, nurses, doctors, and essential workers who never thought they\u2019d be on the frontlines of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Rose, a freshman Democrat, said in the statement. \u201cMy activation and deployment is nothing compared to what our city, state, and country has asked of all them. And it\u2019s certainly nothing compared to the other men and women serving in uniform both here at home and overseas. I am just trying to do my duty and my small part.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said he believes the country is already starting to see the effects of social distancing restrictions. \u201cIf you look now, we\u2019re starting to see glimmers that [social distancing] is actually having some dampening effect,\u201d Fauci told CNN. Fauci\u2019s comments come as officials in the San Francisco area are reporting they are seeing fewer coronavirus cases than expected two weeks after ordering residents to stay home. But Fauci added that he is skeptical about some potential treatments for coronavirus, such as the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, which Trump has said could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against the virus. \u201cYou have to hearken back to the facts,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThere is no definitive evidence that this works.\u201d Republican senator Rick Scott called for most testing to be done in his home state of Florida, where governor Ron DeSantis has not yet issued a statewide \u201cstay at home\u201d order. DeSantis has faced some criticism over his response to the virus after footage circulated of spring breakers visiting Florida beaches earlier this month. But Scott resisted criticism of DeSantis in a CNBC interview this morning. \u201cI\u2019m not going to second guess somebody in the middle of a crisis,\u201d Scott said. But the freshman senator added: \u201cHere\u2019s where I think Florida needs to step up: we have to get more testing done.\u201d House majority leader Steny Hoyer urged members to keep their schedules \u201cvery flexible\u201d in the weeks and months to come. Hoyer said yesterday that the House was not expected to reconvene until 20 April , but the Democratic leader warned the chamber will later have to make up for time lost because of the pandemic. \u201cI would urge you to keep your schedules very flexible,\u201d Hoyer wrote in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to House members. \u201cIn order to make up for time that has been lost, the House may meet during weeks that had previously been scheduled as District Work Periods, and four-day weeks may become five-day weeks.\u201d Ohio Governor Mike DeWine complained about the lack of \u201cwidespread testing\u201d in a CNN interview this morning, echoing reported complaints from other governors. DeWine, who has been widely praised for his aggressive response to the virus, said the state would see its peak number of cases sometime between mid-April and mid-May, but it is difficult to know for sure because of the current level of testing. Montana Governor Steve Bullock reportedly complained to Trump yesterday that his state has struggled to identify and track coronavirus patients because of inadequate testing. But DeWine said he believed the social distancing measures being practiced across the state are already having an effect and urged residents to continue respecting the guidelines. \u201cMy message to my fellow Ohioans is that we can\u2019t let up now,\u201d DeWine said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to really, really stay at this.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats\u2019 fourth coronavirus bill would help to serve state and local leaders grappling with the pandemic. On a call yesterday with reporters, Pelosi said the legislation would include proposals on clean water, infrastructure and rural broadband. However, in a separate interview this morning, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell downplayed the possibility of passing such legislation. \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow this to be an opportunity for the Democrats to achieve unrelated policy items they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to pass,\u201d McConnell said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi also commented on her tense relationship with the president amid the coronavirus pandemic. (The pair have not spoken in five months.) \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019m sure we will speak,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC. But she added that she didn\u2019t know what she would learn from speaking to Trump. The House speaker said she mostly communicates with Trump through television interviews. \u201cThat is what he hears is what people say publicly \u2013 much more than in a call,\u201d Pelosi said. House speaker Nancy Pelosi made an appearance on MSNBC this morning and called for more testing to fight the coronavirus crisis. \u201cProper testing, that has been a problem since the start,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cTesting, testing, testing.\u201d Governors reportedly complained to Trump yesterday that they have struggled to provide adequate testing in their states. Pelosi, who has been extremely critical of the White House\u2019s handling of the pandemic, also defended Congress\u2019 handling of the crisis, saying she is \u201cproud\u201d of the work lawmakers have done. Trump quickly weighed in on the Democratic speaker\u2019s appearance over Twitter, saying she \u201cwasn\u2019t bad\u201d despite her \u201cusual complaining.\u201d Hello and welcome to our live blog coverage of the coronavirus emergency. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday night that the peak number of concurrent cases in the state, still the country\u2019s foremost hotspot, was expected to arrive in the coming six to 21 days. As of Tuesday morning there were more than 164,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the United States and 3,161 had died, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University. In New York state there were 67,384 confirmed cases and 1,342 deaths. Neighboring New Jersey had the second-most cases with 16,636 cases and 198 deaths. In an animated conversation with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, his younger brother, Andrew Cuomo, the governor, whose handling of the crisis has won strong approval, denied that he would respond to calls from some quarters that he run for president. Cuomo also had nice words for Donald Trump, who has demanded praise from governors as a condition of their states receiving federal aid. Cuomo\u2019s praise in this case found its mark, with Fox News picking up the comment and Trump tweeting about it. Here\u2019s a bit of the interview:",
